In the context of a medical imaging analysis application, you are tasked with developing a CycleGAN-based model for domain adaptation between two different types of medical images (e.g., MRI and CT scans). The CycleGAN consists of two generators and two discriminators. The generators are responsible for translating images from one domain to another and vice versa, while the discriminators aim to distinguish between real and generated images.

The given code snippet provides a setup for initializing the CycleGAN components using PyTorch, including the generators (`G_AB` and `G_BA`), discriminators (`D_A` and `D_B`), and a Graph Neural Network (`model_gnn`) for feature extraction. Additionally, loss functions and optimizers are defined for training the model.

Your task is to write a Python function `initialize_cyclegan_components` that initializes all the components of the CycleGAN model and returns them in a dictionary. The function should also ensure that all components are moved to the GPU for efficient computation.

The function should follow these specifications:

- The function should take an `Options` object as input, which contains all the necessary hyperparameters for the model components.
- The function should return a dictionary with the following keys: `'G_AB'`, `'G_BA'`, `'D_A'`, `'D_B'`, `'model_gnn'`, `'criterionIdt'`, `'criterionCycle'`, `'criterionGEN'`, `'optimizer_G'`, `'optimizer_D'`, and `'optimizer_M'`.
- Each key should map to the corresponding initialized component.
- All components should be moved to the GPU using `.cuda()` method.
- The function should handle the case where CUDA is not available by moving components to the CPU.

Design a Python class that provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) interface to interact with an SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module. The class should be able to connect to a database, list available tables, build and execute SELECT queries, and load query results into a pandas DataFrame. Additionally, create two subclasses that provide specialized methods to interact with specific tables: `Customers` and `Employees`.

The main class, `MyConn`, should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, filename=None)`: Initializes a new connection to the SQLite database specified by `filename`.
- `list_tables(self)`: Lists all tables in the connected database.
- `build_select_all_query(self, table_name=None)`: Builds a SELECT * query for the given `table_name`.
- `get_table_description(self, table_name=None)`: Retrieves the column information for the given `table_name`.
- `load_table_as_df(self, table_name)`: Loads the entire table specified by `table_name` into a pandas DataFrame.
- `load_query_as_df(self, query)`: Executes a given SQL `query` and loads the results into a pandas DataFrame.

The `Customers` subclass should have the following additional methods:
- `select_customers_by_state(self, state=None)`: Selects all customers from the `customers` table that are located in the specified `state`.
- `select_customers_by_country(self, country=None)`: Selects all customers from the `customers` table that are located in the specified `country`.

The `Employees` subclass should have the following additional method:
- `get_employees_by_title(self, jobtitle=None)`: Selects all employees from the `employees` table that have the specified `jobtitle`.

Create a Python function named `display_spike_trains` that uses the `ephyviewer` library to visualize spike train data for neuroscientific analysis. The function should take a list of spike train data, where each spike train is represented as a list of spike times (in seconds). The function should display an interactive window with the spike trains plotted, allowing users to visually inspect the activity of neurons over time.

The function should adhere to the following specifications:

1. The function should be named `display_spike_trains`.
2. The function should accept a single parameter `spike_trains_list`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a spike train with spike times.
3. The function should create a fake spike train source using the provided spike train data.

Design a search API for a municipal signals system that allows users to search for signals and status messages using Elasticsearch. The API should support fuzzy searching, sorting, pagination, and filtering based on certain fields. The signals and status messages are stored in an Elasticsearch index and are represented by the `SignalDocument` and `StatusMessagesSearch` classes, respectively.

The API should consist of two views:
1. `SearchSignalsView` - This view should allow users to search for signals by a search term and sort the results by the `created_at` field. It should also support pagination.
2. `SearchStatusMessagesView` - This view should allow users to search for status messages by a search term and filter the results by `state` and `active` fields. It should also support pagination.

Both views should handle cases where the Elasticsearch service is unavailable and return appropriate error messages. The API should be secured with JWT authentication and should only be accessible to users with the appropriate permissions.

Write a function `allocate_budget` that takes two arguments: a list of integers `requests` representing the funding requests from various departments, and an integer `budget` representing the total available budget. The function should allocate the budget to as many departments as possible without exceeding the total available budget.

The funding requests are not in any particular order, and the goal is to maximize the number of departments that receive their full funding request. If there are multiple ways to achieve this, prefer the one that uses the smallest amount of the total budget.

Write a Python program that uses the `aioredis` library to implement a simple asynchronous key-value store with the following functionalities:

1. Connect to a Redis server.
2. Set a value for a given key with an optional expiration time.
3. Get the value associated with a given key.
4. Delete a key-value pair.

The program should include a class `AsyncKeyValueStore` with the following methods:

- `__init__(self, host, port, db, password)`: Initializes a new instance of the class and connects to the Redis server.
- `set_key(self, key, value, expire=None)`: Asynchronously sets the value for the given key. If `expire` is provided, the key will expire after `expire` seconds.
- `get_key(self, key)`: Asynchronously retrieves the value for the given key. If the key does not exist, it should return `None`.
- `delete_key(self, key)`: Asynchronously deletes the key-value pair for the given key.

Design a Python class that represents a system for managing mass editing operations on database records. The system should allow users to create mass editing templates that can be applied to multiple records of a specific model. Each template should have a unique name, be associated with a specific model, and contain a list of editing lines that define the fields to be edited and their new values. Additionally, the system should support the creation and deletion of sidebar actions to make the templates available within a user interface.

The class should include the following features:
- A method to create a new mass editing template with a unique name and associated model.
- A method to add editing lines to a template, specifying the field to be edited and the new value.
- A method to create a sidebar action for a template, which includes the template's name and associated model.
- A method to delete a sidebar action for a template.
- A method to delete a mass editing template, which should also remove any associated sidebar actions.
- A method to copy a template, creating a duplicate with a modified name to indicate it's a copy.

The class should enforce the uniqueness of template names and handle any inheritance relationships between models when determining which records can be edited by a template.

Create a Python program that processes motion capture data from `.trc` files and categorizes them into different groups based on their file names. The program should define a class `MotionDataProcessor` with methods to load data, detect reference points, and save categorized results into CSV files. The program should also include a method to perform dynamic programming (DP) analysis between two sets of data.

The `MotionDataProcessor` class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, data_dir, super_dir)`: Initialize the processor with the directory containing `.trc` files and the directory to save output.
- `load_data(self, file_range, category)`: Load data from `.trc` files within a specified range and assign a category to them.
- `detect_reference(self, output_filename, verbose=False, verbose_nan=False)`: Detect reference points in the loaded data and save the results to a CSV file with the given name.
- `perform_dp_analysis(self, input_filename, reference_filename)`: Perform dynamic programming analysis between the input data and the reference data, both specified by their filenames.

Implement a `MultiHeadedAttention` module that performs multi-head self-attention on a sequence of embeddings. The module should be able to handle variable sequence lengths and should support masking to ignore certain positions within the sequence (e.g., padding tokens).

The `MultiHeadedAttention` module should be initialized with the number of heads `h`, the dimensionality of the model `d_model`, the dimensionality of each key/query `d_k`, the dimensionality of each value `d_v`, and the dropout rate `dropout`.

The `forward` method should take as input the `query`, `key`, and `value` tensors, all of which have the shape `(batch_size, max_sent_length, embedding_size)`, and an optional `mask` tensor of shape `(batch_size, max_sent_length)`. The `mask` tensor should contain `1`s for positions to attend to and `0`s for positions to ignore.

The output of the `forward` method should be a tensor of shape `(batch_size, max_sent_length, embedding_size)` that represents the attended embeddings.

You are tasked with creating a data processing pipeline for a machine learning model that generates text based on a given context. The model requires input data to be tokenized and formatted in a specific way before it can be used for training or inference. The given code snippet provides a foundation for this task, but it needs to be expanded into a complete solution.

Write a Python function `encode_dataset` that takes a dataset consisting of source-target pairs and a tokenizer, and returns a list of encoded examples. Each example in the dataset is a dictionary with two keys: `'srcs'` and `'tgts'`, where `'srcs'` is a string representing the context and `'tgts'` is the string representing the target text to be generated.

The function should use the provided `encode_example` function to encode each example in the dataset. The `encode_example` function uses a tokenizer to encode the source and target texts, handling special tokens and padding.

Additionally, implement the `DataCollator` class as a callable that takes a list of features (encoded examples) and returns a batch suitable for input to a machine learning model. The collator should stack the individual components of the features and handle the conversion to tensors.

Ensure that your solution includes the following:
- Import statements for all required packages.
- A docstring for the `encode_dataset` function explaining its parameters, return value, and any assumptions made.
- A docstring for the `DataCollator` class explaining its purpose and usage.
- Test cases that demonstrate the functionality of `encode_dataset` and `DataCollator` with a mock tokenizer and a sample dataset.

Design a system to automate the transition of tender statuses in an e-procurement platform. The system should handle different types of tenders, such as below-threshold, open UA, and open UA defense tenders. Each tender type has its own set of rules for transitioning between statuses based on the number of bids, complaints, and auction results.

The system should be able to:
- Transition a tender to 'unsuccessful' if there are no bids.
- Set the auction period for tenders without bids.
- Transition a tender to 'qualification' if there is at least one bid.
- Handle complaints and transition tenders accordingly.
- Transition a tender to 'auction' when it's ready for auction.
- Handle tenders with lots, including setting auction periods and transitioning lot statuses.

Given a binary tree, a ""ZigZag"" path for a binary tree is defined as follow: choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left). If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child. Change the direction from right to left or from left to right. Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.

Write a function `longestZigZag` that finds the length of the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree. The length of the path is defined as the number of edges between the starting node and the ending node.

In this solution, we use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and keep track of the longest ZigZag path.

- Function definition with one or more parameters (e.g., `f(x,y):x+y`)
- Arithmetic expressions with addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`)
- Parentheses to control the order of operations
- Built-in functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`
- User-defined functions that can call other functions or use variables in their definitions
- Error handling for undefined variables or functions

Write a Python program that implements a simple machine learning model to classify images into four categories: glass, paper, metal, and trash (others). The program should use the Haar cascade classifier from the OpenCV library to train the model on a given dataset of images. The dataset is organized into separate folders for each category, and the images are loaded using a custom function `load_images`.

The program should follow these steps:
1. Load images from the dataset using the `load_images` function, which takes a file path as an argument and returns a list of images.
2. Create training data by labeling the images with appropriate category labels (1 for glass, 0 for others).
3. Convert the training data into numpy arrays for compatibility with OpenCV.
4. Initialize and train the Haar cascade classifier using the training data.
5. Save the trained classifier to an XML file for later use.

The `load_images` function is not implemented in the given code snippet and should be completed as part of the solution.

Design a class `ResultProcessor` that processes paginated results from an API. The class should have a method `run` that takes a result dictionary containing a 'data' list and a 'metadata' dictionary. The 'metadata' dictionary includes a 'page' key indicating the current page number. The `run` method should also accept an optional `per_page` parameter that specifies the number of items per page. If `per_page` is not provided, all items should be returned.

The `run` method should return a new dictionary with the following structure:
- 'data': A list containing the items for the current page.
- 'metadata': A dictionary containing:
  - 'page': The current page number.
  - 'perPage': The number of items returned in 'data'.

Write a test suite using `pytest` to verify that the `ResultProcessor` works correctly. The test suite should use fixtures to provide the input data and use parametrization to test different scenarios, including cases where `per_page` is not provided and cases with different page numbers and items per page.

Design a simple multiplayer game server that allows players to connect, move around in a 2D space, and keep track of their score. The server should be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously, each represented by a unique ID, name, and skin. The server should also assign a random starting location and color to each player, ensuring that the color is not too bright (the sum of the RGB values should be less than 720).

The server should accept the following commands from the clients:
- ""move x y"": Update the player's position to (x, y).
- ""id"": Request the player's unique ID.
- ""get"": Request the current state of all players in the game.

The server should be robust, handling client disconnections gracefully and removing disconnected players from the game state.

Implement the server using Python's `socket` and `threading` libraries, and use `pickle` to serialize and deserialize data sent over the network.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to create a client script that connects to the server and sends various commands. Since the server is designed to run indefinitely and handle multiple clients, the test cases would be the interactions between the client and the server.

For example, a client script could:
1. Connect to the server.
2. Send its name and skin.
3. Send a ""move"" command with new coordinates.
4. Request its ID with the ""id"" command.
5. Request the state of all players with the ""get"" command.
6. Disconnect from the server.

You would then verify that the server responds correctly to each command and updates the game state as expected. The test cases would be run manually by observing the server's output and ensuring it matches the expected behavior.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a RESTful API endpoint for a simple note-taking application using Flask. The endpoint should allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes. Each note should have a unique identifier, a title, and a content field. The API should follow REST principles and use JSON for data serialization.

Implement the `NoteResource` class, which extends the provided `Resource` class, to handle the CRUD operations for notes. The `NoteResource` class should define the necessary URL rules and methods for the following endpoints:

- `POST /notes`: Create a new note with a generated unique identifier, title, and content provided in the request body.
- `GET /notes/<note_id>`: Retrieve a note by its unique identifier.
- `PUT /notes/<note_id>`: Update the title and content of an existing note by its unique identifier.
- `DELETE /notes/<note_id>`: Delete a note by its unique identifier.

The `NoteResource` class should also handle common HTTP errors and return appropriate responses. Use the provided code snippet as a starting point for implementing the `NoteResource` class and its methods.

You are tasked with merging two datasets: one containing votes for scenic quality of geographic locations (scenicornot_votes.tsv) and another containing images taken in London (images_in_london.csv). The scenic quality votes are on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most scenic. You need to write a Python program that reads both datasets, combines them by adding the average scenic quality vote to the images dataset, and outputs a new CSV file (images_in_london_and_son.csv) that includes all the original fields from the images dataset plus a new field 'SON_AVG' for the scenic quality average. Only images with a scenic quality average of 3.0 or higher should be included in the new dataset.

The scenicornot_votes.tsv file has the following columns:
- 'Geograph URI': the unique identifier for the location, which is part of the URL and can be extracted as the last segment.
- 'Average': the average scenic quality vote for the location.

The images_in_london.csv file has several fields, including:
- 'gridimage_id': the unique identifier that matches the 'Geograph URI' in the scenicornot_votes.tsv file.

Your program should:
- Read the scenicornot_votes.tsv file and store the average votes in a dictionary with the 'Geograph URI' identifier as the key.
- Read the images_in_london.csv file and append a new field 'SON_AVG' to its fieldnames.
- Write a new CSV file, images_in_london_and_son.csv, with the combined data, including the new 'SON_AVG' field only for those records with an average vote of 3.0 or higher.
- Ensure that the new CSV file includes headers.

Implement a system that tracks changes in agent queue assignments and penalties in a call center environment. The system should be able to detect when an agent is added to a new queue, removed from an existing queue, or when their penalty level in a queue has changed. The penalty level is a numeric value that determines the priority of the agent in the queue.

The system should consist of two main components:
1. `QueueDelta`: A class that calculates the difference between the old and new state of an agent's queues.
2. `OnAgentUpdatedManager`: A class that manages the actions to be taken when an agent is updated.

The `QueueDelta` class should have a method `calculate` that takes two lists of queue objects (`old_queues` and `new_queues`) and returns an object with three attributes: `added`, `removed`, and `penalty_updated`. Each attribute should be a list of queue objects that represent the queues that have been added, removed, or had their penalty updated, respectively.

The `OnAgentUpdatedManager` class should have a method `on_agent_updated` that takes an `agent` object as an argument. This method should use the `QueueDelta` to determine the changes and then perform the necessary actions using the provided action handlers: `add_to_queue_action`, `remove_from_queue_action`, and `update_penalty_action`. These action handlers are mocks that simulate adding an agent to a queue, removing an agent from a queue, and updating an agent's penalty in a queue.

Write a Python program that processes an astronomical image to identify and annotate stars within the image. The program should use the `Focuser` class (a hypothetical class for the purpose of this question) to evaluate the image and draw annotations on the image for each star found. The annotations should include the star's parameters and statistics provided by the `Focuser` class.

The program should:
- Open an image file whose name is provided as a command-line argument.
- Use the `Focuser` class to find stars in the image.
- If no stars are found, print a message and exit the program.
- Normalize the image if its maximum pixel value is greater than or equal to 256.
- Create annotated images for each star found, with the annotations including the star's parameters and statistics.
- Save the annotated images as PNG files with the star's parameter included in the filename.

The `Focuser` class has the following methods:
- `evaluate(image)`: Analyzes the image and identifies stars.
- `num()`: Returns the number of stars found.
- `get(par)`: Returns an object with the star's parameters and statistics for the given parameter `par`.
- `draw(context, par)`: Draws annotations on the image for the given parameter `par`.

The star's parameters and statistics object has the following attributes:
- `bot`: The bottom value of the star's intensity.
- `p10`: The 10th percentile of the star's intensity.
- `mean`: The mean value of the star's intensity.
- `p90`: The 90th percentile of the star's intensity.
- `top`: The top value of the star's intensity.
- `std`: The standard deviation of the star's intensity.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have an image file with stars and the `focuser` module with the `Focuser` class properly implemented. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, we cannot provide real test cases. However, you can imagine the following scenarios for testing:

1. Run the program with an image file containing several stars. The program should output annotated images for each star found.
2. Run the program with an image file containing no stars. The program should print ""No stars found"" and exit.
3. Run the program with an image file containing very bright stars that cause pixel values to exceed 255. The program should normalize the image and then output annotated images for each star found.

Please note that the `focuser` module and the `Focuser` class are not real and are used here for the purpose of the question. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement or have access to a similar module and class to perform the required image analysis and annotation.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Telegram bot that interacts with users to provide information about Pokémon. The bot should be able to handle two commands: `/start` and `/hello`, as well as user messages that contain Pokémon IDs. When a user sends a Pokémon ID, the bot should reply with the name of the Pokémon and a link to its information page. If the Pokémon ID is not found, the bot should inform the user that no Pokémon was found with that ID.

The bot should use the provided `get_pokemon_name_by_scraping` function from the `utils` module to retrieve the Pokémon name based on the given ID. The function `get_pokemon_name_by_scraping(pokemon_id)` takes a string `pokemon_id` and returns the corresponding Pokémon name as a string if found, or `None` if not found.

Implement the bot using the Python `telegram.ext` module, and ensure that it can handle the `/start` and `/hello` commands, as well as user messages for Pokémon IDs. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

**Test Cases**:

Since the solution involves a Telegram bot, traditional unit tests may not be applicable. However, you can manually test the bot by interacting with it on Telegram:

1. Send the `/start` command to the bot. The bot should reply with ""Enter the Pokémon ID to search for"".
2. Send a valid Pokémon ID (e.g., ""25"" for Pikachu). The bot should reply with a link to the Pokémon's information page.
3. Send an invalid Pokémon ID (e.g., ""9999""). The bot should reply with ""No Pokémon found with that ID"".
4. Send the `/hello` command to the bot. The bot should reply with ""Hello [Your First Name]"".

To automate these tests, you would need to simulate Telegram API calls, which is beyond the scope of this example.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane. The program should define a function `euclidean_distance(point1, point2)` where `point1` and `point2` are tuples representing the coordinates of the two points. The function should return the Euclidean distance between these points.

The Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is given by the formula:

\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \]

The program should include proper error handling to check if the provided inputs are tuples containing two numeric values each. If the input is invalid, the function should raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

Additionally, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Write a Python script that takes a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keyring file, and splits it into multiple keyring files based on the first hexadecimal character of each key's fingerprint. The script should distribute the keys into a specified number of partitions, creating separate directories for each partitioned keyring.

The script should be able to handle the following:
- Accept command-line arguments for the input keyring directory, the base directory for output keyrings, and the number of partitions.
- Use the `gpgme` library to interact with GPG keyrings.
- Create the necessary output directories if they do not exist.
- Export keys from the input keyring and import them into the appropriate partitioned keyring based on the first character of the key's fingerprint.
- Print out the number of keys successfully moved and the number of failures.

The script should be robust, handling any potential errors that may occur during the keyring manipulation process.

Create a Python program that simulates a simple level-based game using the Turtle graphics library. The game should display a scoreboard that keeps track of the current level the player is on. The player can increase the level by pressing the ""Up"" arrow key. When the player reaches level 10, the game should display a ""GAME OVER"" message in the center of the screen and stop responding to further key presses.

The program should follow these specifications:

1. Use the provided `Scoreboard` class to create a scoreboard object that displays the current level at the top-left corner of the screen.
2. The scoreboard should start at level 1 and increase by 1 each time the ""Up"" arrow key is pressed.
3. When the level reaches 10, the scoreboard should display ""GAME OVER"" in the center of the screen and no longer respond to key presses.
4. The game should use the Turtle graphics library to handle the drawing and key press events.
5. Include test cases to verify that the scoreboard updates correctly and that the game over functionality works as expected.

Implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for a simple weather system and use it to simulate weather observations. The weather system has three states: Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy. The transition probabilities between these states are given, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the temperature observations associated with each state. The task is to simulate a sequence of weather states and corresponding temperature observations, and then compute the likelihood of the observed sequence using the Forward and Backward algorithms.

The HMM should be able to:
1. Simulate a sequence of weather states based on the transition probabilities.
2. Simulate a sequence of temperature observations based on the current weather state.
3. Calculate the likelihood of an observed sequence of temperatures using the Forward algorithm.
4. Calculate the likelihood of an observed sequence of temperatures using the Backward algorithm.

The `HMM` class and `build_pdf` function are provided to assist with these tasks. The `HMM` class should be initialized with the number of states, the transition matrix, and the means and standard deviations for the temperature observations in each state. The `build_pdf` function creates a probability density function for the temperature observations given a mean and standard deviation.

Write a function `count_digit_one` that counts the number of times the digit 1 appears in all numbers from 1 to a given integer `n`. The digit 1 can appear in any position of a number. For example, in the number 13, the digit 1 appears once, and in the number 111, the digit 1 appears three times.

The function should take an integer `n` as input and return the total count of digit one appearing in all numbers from 1 to `n`.

","

```python
'''
Problem Description:
The function count_digit_one is designed to count the total number of times the digit 1 appears in all numbers from 1 to a given integer n. This includes 1 appearing in any position within the number.

For example:
- count_digit_one(13) should return 6 because the digit 1 appears in the numbers 1, 10, 11 (twice), 12, and 13.
- count_digit_one(0) should return 0 because there are no numbers between 1 and 0.

Parameters:
- n (int): The upper limit integer up to which the count of digit one is to be calculated.

Returns:
- int: The total count of digit one appearing in all numbers from 1 to n.
'''

class Solution:
    def count_digit_one(self, n: int) -> int:
        n_str = str(n)
        n_str = n_str[::-1]
        count = 0

            # Lower bound
            count += n // (10 ** (i + 1)) * (10 ** i)
            dig = int(n_str[i])
            # Upper bound - three cases based on the current digit being >1, =1, or =0 (when it's 0, the count is also 0)
            if dig > 1:
                count += 10 ** i
            elif dig == 1:
                count += n % (10 ** (i)) + 1

Implement a Python program that simulates Conway's Game of Life using the Pygame library. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die, or multiply. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

The program should have the following features:

1. A grid where each cell can be in one of two states: alive (white) or dead (black).
2. The ability to manually configure the initial state of the grid by clicking on cells to toggle their state before the simulation starts.
3. A menu with two options: ""Configure Cells Manually"" and ""Start the Game"". The user can navigate through the menu using the up and down arrow keys and select an option with the enter key.
4. Once the game starts, the grid should update at a consistent rate (e.g., 10 frames per second), applying the rules of Conway's Game of Life:
   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
5. The simulation should continue running until the user closes the window.

Write a Python program that defines a class `JobStatus` to manage job statuses in a computing environment. The class should contain a set of predefined statuses that a job can have during its lifecycle. Additionally, the program should include a function `parse_status` that takes a list of status codes (which can be full status strings, single-letter abbreviations, or special keywords) and returns a list of valid, normalized status strings.

The `JobStatus` class should have the following predefined statuses:
- `COMPLETED`: Indicates that the job has finished successfully.
- `UNSUBMITTED`: Indicates that the job has not yet been submitted for execution.
- `RUNNING`: Indicates that the job is currently in execution.
- `PENDING`: Indicates that the job is waiting to be executed.
- `FAILED`: Indicates that the job has finished with an error.
- `OTHER`: Indicates an unknown or unhandled status.

The `parse_status` function should handle the following cases:
- If the input list contains `'all'` or `'a'`, it should return all possible statuses except for `OTHER`.
- If the input list contains a valid full status string, it should be included in the output list.
- If the input list contains a valid single-letter abbreviation (the first letter of a status), it should be expanded to the full status string and included in the output list.
- If the input list contains an invalid status or abbreviation, the function should raise a custom exception `QMapError` with an appropriate error message.

The program should include test cases to verify the correctness of the `parse_status` function.

Design a RESTful API for a Todo application using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. The API should allow users to manage their todo items, including creating new todos, retrieving a list of all todos, getting a specific todo by ID, updating the completion status of a todo, and deleting a todo. Each todo item should have an ID, a description, and a boolean indicating whether it is complete.

The API should follow these specifications:

1. The base URL for the todo endpoints should be `/todo`.
2. The API should have the following endpoints:
   - `GET /todo/`: Retrieve a list of all todo items.
   - `GET /todo/{id}`: Retrieve a specific todo item by its ID.
   - `POST /todo/`: Create a new todo item. The request body should contain the description of the todo and its initial completion status.
   - `PATCH /todo/{id}`: Update the completion status of a todo item by its ID. The completion status should be toggled (i.e., if it was `False`, it should become `True`, and vice versa).
   - `DELETE /todo/{id}`: Delete a specific todo item by its ID.

3. The API should handle errors gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages when a todo item is not found or when there is a problem with the request.

4. The API should use SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions, and the database session should be managed using dependency injection with FastAPI's `Depends`.

Write a Python program that processes a text file to extract and count email addresses. The program should define a function `extract_and_count_emails` that takes a file path as its argument and returns a tuple containing a list of email addresses and a dictionary with the count of each email address found in the file.

The file is expected to contain lines of text, and an email address is considered to be present on a line if the line starts with the word ""From "". The email address on such a line is the second word of the line. The program should ignore case when counting email addresses.

Additionally, the program should identify the email address with the highest occurrence in the file and print it along with its count.

Here are the requirements for the function `extract_and_count_emails`:

- It should accept a single argument: the file path as a string.
- It should return a tuple containing:
  - A list of email addresses extracted from the file.

Write a Python program that simulates a project management system with the ability to open and load projects. The system should be able to handle various scenarios such as non-existent projects, loading failures, and initialization errors. The program should include a `ProjectOpener` class with the following methods:

1. `project_exists(path)`: Checks if the project exists at the given path.
2. `load_project(response, path)`: Attempts to load the project from the given path and updates the response object accordingly.
3. `open_project(path, forget)`: Opens the project if it exists and is loadable. The `forget` parameter determines whether to update recent paths.
4. `initialize_results(response, project)`: Initializes result paths for the given project and updates the response object.

The `Response` class should be used to track the success or failure of operations and to store any error messages. The program should also include a set of unit tests to verify the functionality of the `ProjectOpener` class under various conditions, such as when projects do not exist, fail to load, or encounter initialization errors.

You are given a number of steps `steps` and an array length `arrLen`. You start at the first position of an imaginary array (position 0) and you can move either one step to the right, one step to the left, or stay in the same place (The first and the last positions of the array are the leftmost and rightmost positions respectively). However, you can't move outside the bounds of the array at any point in time.

Write a function `numWays` that takes `steps` and `arrLen` as arguments and returns the number of distinct ways you can arrive back at the start position (position 0) after exactly `steps` steps. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Write a Python script that automates the process of downloading Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data tiles from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM data repository. The script should allow users to specify the type of data (GeoTIFF or ASCII), the output directory to store the downloaded tiles, and optionally a specific tile to download. If no specific tile is provided, the script should download all available tiles of the specified type.

The script should handle interruptions gracefully, allowing the user to cancel the download process with a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C). It should also handle any request exceptions by retrying the download. The script should provide informative messages about the download progress and any issues encountered.

Write a Python script that interacts with the Flickr API to download and save photo information based on their license type. The script should:

1. Load API credentials from a `.env` file located one directory above the current working directory.
2. Use the `flickrapi` Python library to search for photos on Flickr with different Creative Commons license types.
3. Save the photo information for each license type in a dictionary, where the keys are the license type IDs and the values are lists of photo data in JSON format.
4. Write the dictionary to a file named `photos.json` in the current working directory.
5. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution and exit the script with appropriate exit codes.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have a valid `.env` file with `FLICKR_API_KEY` and `FLICKR_API_SECRET` set to valid credentials. Then, running the script should result in the creation of a `photos.json` file in the current working directory with the photo information organized by license type.

Since the actual API call requires valid credentials and network access, the test cases here are more about the script's ability to handle errors and write to a file correctly.

Design a Django GraphQL API that allows querying for job postings by ZIP code and city, as well as by branch and job type within a specific ZIP code and city. The API should enforce that only public job postings are returned in the queries. The system should also handle user permissions, allowing only authenticated users to query for job postings.

Write two test cases using Pytest to verify the functionality of the API. The first test case should verify that the query for job postings by ZIP code and city returns the correct data without errors. The second test case should verify that the query for job postings by branch and job type within a specific ZIP code and city returns the correct data without errors.

Both test cases ensure that no errors are returned and that the data is as expected.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Implement a Python class `CatBoostClassifierWrapper` that wraps around the `CatBoostClassifier` from the `catboost` library. This wrapper should provide a simplified interface for training and predicting with CatBoost models for classification tasks. The class should have the following features:

1. The class should have a constructor that accepts three optional parameters with default values: `n_estimators=50`, `max_depth=3`, and `learning_rate=0.1`. These parameters should be used to set up the underlying `CatBoostClassifier`.

2. The class should have a `fit` method that takes two arguments, `X` and `y`, where `X` is a pandas DataFrame of features, and `y` is a pandas Series of target labels. This method should train the CatBoost model on the provided data.

3. The class should have a `predict` method that takes a pandas DataFrame `X` and returns a pandas Series of predictions.

4. The class should have a `score` method that takes two arguments, `X` and `y`, and returns the accuracy of the model on the provided data.

5. The class should have a `get_params` method that returns a dictionary of the current parameters of the underlying CatBoost model.

6. The class should have class variables `name`, `primary_type`, `secondary_type`, and `tertiary_type` set to ""Catboost Classifier"", ""classification"", ""None"", and ""tree"" respectively.

7. The class should have a class variable `hyperparameters` that is a dictionary with keys ""n_estimators"", ""max_depth"", and ""learning_rate"".

Write unit tests using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the `CatBoostClassifierWrapper` class. The tests should check the class variables, the return types of methods, the length of predictions, and the accuracy score.

2. **Navigation Menu**: Once authenticated, users should see a horizontal navigation menu with the following options: 'Overview', 'Contact Pages', and 'Account'. Each option should have an associated icon.

3. **Page Content**: Depending on the selected option from the navigation menu, the corresponding page content should be displayed:
    - 'Overview': Display a summary of the user's interactions and activities.

**Test Cases**:

Since Streamlit applications are interactive and run in a browser, traditional unit tests are not applicable. However, you can manually test the application by running the script and interacting with the web interface to ensure that:

1. The authentication page is displayed when the user is not authenticated.
2. The navigation menu appears after authentication, and the correct page content is displayed when an option is selected.
3. The 'Report a bug' menu item opens the default email client with the pre-filled subject line.
4. The query parameters are correctly used to pass user information and authentication status.

For automated testing, you would need to use tools like Selenium to interact with the web application in a browser and verify its behavior.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class `WindowGenerator` that creates input and label windows from time series data for use in machine learning models, particularly for training recurrent neural networks. The class should be able to handle multivariate time series data and allow the user to specify which columns should be used as labels.

The `WindowGenerator` class should have the following features:

1. Initialization with parameters to define the window size for inputs (`input_width`), the window size for labels (`label_width`), the shift between the end of the input window and the start of the label window (`shift`), training data frame (`train_df`), validation data frame (`val_df`), test data frame (`test_df`), and optionally the label columns (`label_columns`).

2. A `split_window` method that takes a batch of consecutive inputs and splits it into a window of inputs and a window of labels.

3. A `make_dataset` method that converts a time series data frame into a TensorFlow `Dataset` of (input_window, label_window) pairs.

4. Properties to access the parameters of the datasets generated by `make_dataset`.

5. A `__repr__` method to print the window parameters for easy debugging.

Implement a singleton design pattern for a class hierarchy where the base class `Parent` ensures that only one instance of each subclass can be created. The singleton pattern should be such that if an instance of a subclass already exists, the same instance should be returned upon subsequent instantiation attempts.

Additionally, create a subclass `Child` of `Parent` that has an integer attribute `v` initialized to `1234567890`. Ensure that the `Child` class also follows the singleton pattern.

Write a Python program that demonstrates the singleton behavior for both the `Parent` and `Child` classes. The program should create multiple instances of `Parent` and `Child` and print them to show that only one instance of each class is created. Also, print the value of the `v` attribute from the `Child` instance to confirm that the instance retains its state.

```python
class Parent:
    _instances = {}

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):

    def __init__(self):
        print('Parent __init__')


class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    print(""Parent instances:"")
    print(p1)
    print(p2)

    print(""\nChild instances:"")

    print(""\nAre p1 and p2 the same instance?"", p1 is p2)
    print(""Are c1 and c2 the same instance?"", c1 is c2)
```

When you run the above program, you should see output indicating that `Parent __new__` and `Child __init__` are called only once, and that the same instance is returned for both `p1` and `p2`, as well as for `c1` and `c2`. The value of `v` should be printed as `1234567890`, and the checks for instance equality should return `True`.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class named `SnapshotEngine` that interacts with AWS DynamoDB to manage snapshots of a given table. The class should be able to initialize with an engine type and a list of snapshots. It should also provide a class method `build` that takes an engine type and a table name, then retrieves the list of snapshots for that table from DynamoDB, and returns an instance of `SnapshotEngine`.

The snapshots should be represented as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains at least the snapshot identifier and the creation time. Assume that the snapshots are stored in a DynamoDB table with the following schema:
- `SnapshotId` (String): The primary key for the snapshot.
- `CreationTime` (String): The time when the snapshot was created.

The `build` class method should query the DynamoDB table to retrieve all snapshots for the given table name and store them in the `_snapshots` attribute.

Design a Python module that provides utility functions for handling time-related data and extracting information from server responses in the context of a smart home device management system. The module should include the following functionalities:

1. Convert a Unix timestamp string to a human-readable time string with a custom separator.
2. Convert a human-readable time string with a custom separator to a Unix epoch timestamp.
3. Calculate the Unix timestamps for the start and end of the current day (00:00:00 to 23:59:59).
4. Clean up device and module IDs in the raw data by removing any superfluous spaces.
5. Extract raw data from a server response, handling different tags and potential errors, and return a dictionary with the relevant data and any errors.

The module should be robust and handle edge cases, such as missing or malformed data. It should also log debug information when encountering errors.

Design a Python class `ImageDiffusionSampler` that utilizes a diffusion model to generate or edit images. The class should be able to perform the following tasks:

1. **Initialize with a Diffusion Model**: The class should take a pre-trained diffusion model as an input during initialization.

2. **Sample an Image**: Implement a method `sample_image` that takes the number of diffusion steps and optionally an initial latent representation of an image. If the initial latent is provided, the method should perform an image editing process; otherwise, it should generate a new image from scratch.

3. **Apply Masked Blending**: Implement a method `apply_mask` that takes a noisy latent representation, an original latent representation, a binary mask, and a timestep. This method should blend the noisy latent with the original latent according to the mask, hinting the original content to the model for better context learning during the early diffusion steps.

4. **Add Noise to an Image**: Implement a method `add_noise` that takes an initial latent representation and a timestep, and optionally a noise tensor. If the noise tensor is not provided, the method should generate it. The method should return a noised version of the latent representation according to the diffusion model's noise schedule.

The class should also include any necessary utility functions to support these operations, such as ensuring the correct tensor dimensions and converting data to the appropriate device.

You are tasked with developing a machine learning pipeline to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with an additional file for gender-based submission. The pipeline should include data visualization, feature creation, feature evaluation, feature scaling, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Write a Python program that implements the following steps:

1. Load the training and test datasets, along with the gender submission data.
2. Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and target variable (if `Visualize_data` is set to `True`).
3. Create new features from the existing data (if `Create_Features` is set to `True`).
4. Evaluate the importance of features and drop the ones that are not useful (if `Evaluate_features` and `Drop_Poor_Features` are set to `True`).
5. Scale the features to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms (if `Scale_Data` is set to `True`).
6. Study different estimators to choose the best one for the dataset (if `Choosing_Estimator` is set to `True`).
7. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the chosen estimator (if `Tuning_Hyperparameters` is set to `True`).

In a network of computers, each computer can be connected to other computers. A hacker wants to find out the most vulnerable computers in the network. A computer is considered vulnerable if, by hacking it, the hacker can indirectly hack the maximum number of other computers in the network. The network is represented as a directed graph where each directed edge from computer A to computer B means that if computer A is hacked, then computer B can also be hacked indirectly through A.

Write a Python program that takes the number of computers `n`, the number of connections `m`, and a list of `m` connections as input, and outputs the list of the most vulnerable computers in the network. Each connection is a tuple `(a, b)` representing a directed edge from computer `a` to computer `b`.

Your program should implement a function `find_vulnerable_computers(n, connections)` that returns a list of the most vulnerable computers. The function should use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to determine the number of computers that can be hacked from each starting computer.

1. Read the dataset from a file named `dataset.txt`. Each line in the file represents a record, and the text to be processed is the second field in each record, separated by tabs.
2. Use `jieba.cut` to segment the text into words.
3. Collect all unique words across the entire dataset and store them in a set.
4. Write the unique words to a file named `vocab.txt`, each on a new line, with a tab-separated index number starting from 1.

The `vocab.txt` file should have the following format:
```
word1	1
word2	2
word3	3
...
```

```python
import jieba

def create_vocabulary_index(dataset_filename, vocab_filename):

            text = line.strip().split('\t')[1]

To verify the correctness of the solution, you should have a `dataset.txt` file with sample text data and then check the `vocab.txt` file to ensure that it contains the unique words with their corresponding index numbers.

The Moore's Law dataset contains information about the number of transistors in integrated circuits over time. The goal is to model the exponential growth of transistor counts using linear regression after applying a logarithmic transformation to the data.

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

1. Load the Moore's Law dataset from a CSV file, where each line contains a year and the corresponding transistor count, separated by a tab character.
2. Preprocess the data by:
   - Extracting the year and transistor count from each line using regular expressions.
   - Converting the transistor count to a logarithmic scale to linearize the exponential growth.
   - Standardizing the year and logarithmic transistor count by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
3. Implement a linear regression model using PyTorch to fit the standardized data.
4. Train the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a specified learning rate and momentum.
5. Plot the training losses over epochs to visualize the training process.
6. Plot the original data and the line of best fit predicted by the model.
7. Calculate and print the following:
   - The rate of growth `r` as the exponential of the slope of the line of best fit.
   - The time `t_to_double` it takes for the transistor count to double, based on the rate of growth.

Write a Python program that simulates a basic ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) application configuration for a Django project. The program should be able to dynamically set the Django settings module based on the project name provided by the user and then return the ASGI application instance.

The program should follow these requirements:

1. The user should be able to input the name of the Django project (e.g., 'flower_yard').
2. The program should set the environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' to the correct settings path using the project name (e.g., 'flower_yard.settings').
3. The program should then get and return the ASGI application instance.
4. Include a docstring at the beginning of the program explaining the purpose and usage.
5. Provide test cases to verify that the program correctly sets the environment variable and retrieves the ASGI application instance.

**Note**: Assume that the Django environment is properly set up and that `get_asgi_application()` will return a mock ASGI application instance for the purpose of this exercise.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple license check for a Django-based web application. The license check should be based on the MAC address of the machine where the application is running. Each machine should have a unique MAC address that is registered and allowed to run the application. If the MAC address of the current machine is not in the list of registered MAC addresses, the program should raise an exception with a message indicating that the MAC address is not authorized.

The program should include a function `get_mac_address()` that retrieves the current machine's MAC address and a function `main()` that performs the license check. The `main()` function should also attempt to import Django's command-line utility and execute it if the license check passes.

The program should follow these guidelines:
- Use the `uuid` module to obtain the MAC address.
- Use a predefined list of authorized MAC addresses for the license check.
- Provide a clear error message if the MAC address is not authorized.
- Handle the potential `ImportError` when importing Django's command-line utility.
- Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

The Biostatistics Department at a university has a CSV file named `faculty.csv` containing information about faculty members. The CSV file has four columns: name, degree, position, and email. The name column contains the full name of the faculty member, the degree column contains their highest degree, the position column contains their job title, and the email column contains their email address.

Your task is to create three functions to organize and retrieve information from this CSV file:

1. `faculty_dict()`: This function should read the `faculty.csv` file and create a dictionary where the keys are the last names of the faculty members, and the values are lists containing their degree, position, and email. If a last name is shared by multiple faculty members, their information should be stored in a list of lists under the same last name key.

2. `professor_dict()`: This function should read the `faculty.csv` file and create a dictionary where the keys are tuples containing the first and last names of the faculty members, and the values are lists containing their degree, position, and email.

3. `sorted_professors()`: This function should use the dictionary created by `professor_dict()` and return a list of key-value pairs sorted by the last name of the faculty members.

Write the code for these functions following the guidelines and provide test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.

Create a Python program that manages flight schedules for an airport. The program should be able to display the flight schedule sorted by flight number and by departure time. Each flight record contains the airline name, flight number, destination airport code, gate number, and departure time in decimal hours.

The program should include two functions: `schedule_by_flight` and `schedule_by_time`. The `schedule_by_flight` function should print the flight schedule sorted by flight number, and the `schedule_by_time` function should print the flight schedule sorted by departure time. Both functions should display the schedule in a tabular format with the columns: Flight, Destination, Gate, and Time.

The destination airport code should be converted to a full airport name using a provided dictionary of airport codes and their corresponding full names.

Use the provided code snippet as a starting point to implement the two functions and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python program that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into two distinct categories: building floor and direction, and positions within a hallway. The images are grayscale and have a fixed size. The program should include the following functionalities:

1. Preprocessing of image data from two separate directories, one for each category (floor/direction and position), including splitting the data into training and validation sets.
2. Building and training separate CNN models for each category, with the architecture specified in the given code snippet.
3. Saving the trained models to a specified directory.
4. Evaluating the models on the validation sets and printing out the accuracy.

The program should be able to handle the following constraints:

- The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 320x180 pixels.
- The batch size for training and validation should be 15.
- The number of epochs for training is set to 15.

Write a Python program that uses a pre-trained model to parse sentences and generate their syntactic trees. The program should take three command-line arguments: a text file containing sentences to parse, the CUDA device ID for running the model, and the path to the pre-trained model file. The program should load the model, read the sentences from the input file, use the model to predict the syntactic trees for each sentence, and write the trees to an output file. Additionally, the program should print a random syntactic tree to the console with a probability of 0.001 for each sentence processed.

The input file should contain one sentence per line. The output file should contain the syntactic trees in a format where each tree is separated by a newline. The program should handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations or model predictions.

Design a Python program that simulates the movement of a simple car in a 2D environment using matplotlib for visualization. The car's movement is determined by the input from two virtual ""bikes"" that control the car's wheels. The car should be represented as a rectangle with two circles representing the wheels. The car's movement is affected by the input values from the bikes, which simulate the rotation of the wheels.

The car should obey the following rules:
- The car moves forward or backward depending on the average input value from the bikes.
- The car turns left or right based on the difference between the input values from the bikes.
- The car's turning radius is affected by the proximity to the center of the environment (i.e., it turns sharper near the center).

The program should include a function `CollectData(inputBikes, mainForm)` that simulates collecting data from the bikes. This function should return a list of two values representing the rotation speed of each bike's wheel.

The visualization should update in real-time to reflect the car's movement and should include a background image representing the environment.

Design a class `Nodo` that represents a node in a singly linked list with an additional feature. Each node contains an integer `dato`, a string `nombre`, and a special attribute `reducida` which is a reduced form of the `dato`. The reduced form is calculated as the sum of the digits of `dato` until it becomes a single digit. For example, if `dato` is 12345, the reduced form is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, and then 1+5 = 6.

The class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, dato, nombre)`: Initializes a new node with the given `dato` and `nombre`. It should also initialize `reducida` to `None` and `siguiente` to `None`.
- `setReducida(self)`: Calculates the reduced form of `dato` and sets the `reducida` attribute.
- `getReducida(self)`: Returns the value of the `reducida` attribute.
- `__str__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the node in the format ""Nombre: {nombre}, Dato: {dato}, Reducida: {reducida}"".

Additionally, write a function `calcular_reducida(dato)` outside the class that takes an integer and returns its reduced form as described above.

class Nodo():
    def __init__(self, dato, nombre):
        self.dato = dato

        return f""Nombre: {self.nombre}, Dato: {self.dato}, Reducida: {self.reducida}""

def calcular_reducida(dato):
    while dato >= 10:
        dato = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(dato))

    nodo3 = Nodo(0, ""Nodo3"")
    nodo3.setReducida()
    print(nodo3)  # Expected output: Nombre: Nodo3, Dato: 0, Reducida: 0
```

The provided solution defines the `Nodo` class and the `calcular_reducida` function as per the problem description. The test cases check that the `setReducida` method correctly calculates the reduced form of the `dato` and that the `__str__` method returns the expected string representation of the node.",Python,McEval-Instruct

You are tasked with creating a Python script that processes game statistics from a JSON file and generates two CSV files: one for the winning teams and one for the losing teams. Each CSV file should contain a header followed by the game statistics for each team.

The JSON file, `gameTableData.json`, contains game data where each game has a unique identifier and nested information for the winning and losing teams. The script should extract the following information for both winners and losers:

- Game Number (Game ID)
- Team Name
- Passing Yards
- Rushing Yards
- Carries
- Completions
- Attempts
- Interceptions
- Tackles
- Fumbles

If any piece of data is missing, the script should insert a space ("" "") in its place. The script should handle exceptions gracefully, and if an unexpected structure is encountered, it should use the Python Debugger (pdb) to pause execution and allow for interactive debugging.

The output CSV files should be named `gameWinnersTable.csv` and `gameLosersTable.csv`.

Write a Python program that automates the process of sending a custom message to a specified contact or group on WhatsApp using the Selenium WebDriver. The program should allow the user to input the name of the contact or group, the message to be sent, and the number of times the message should be sent. Additionally, the program should append a random number of ""Hi!! "" prefixes to the message each time it is sent.

The program should perform the following steps:
1. Prompt the user for the target contact or group name.
2. Prompt the user for the message to be sent.
3. Prompt the user for the number of times the message should be sent.
4. Use Selenium WebDriver to navigate to WhatsApp Web and wait for the user to scan the QR code.
5. Locate the input field for the target contact or group and click on it.
6. Send the custom message, prefixed with a random number of ""Hi!! "", the specified number of times.
7. Include a 1-second pause between sending each message to avoid being flagged as spam.

Ensure that the program includes error handling for situations such as the contact or group not being found, and that it closes the browser window upon completion.

- `sub(self, a, b)`: Returns the difference when `b` is subtracted from `a`.
- `mult(self, a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.

Write a Python script that simulates a Django migration for a hypothetical `AppUser` model. The `AppUser` model initially has a `document` field that is an `ImageField` with no restrictions on the upload path or file name. The goal of the migration is to alter the `document` field so that it now has a maximum length of 200 characters for the file name and uses a custom function `new_document_filename` to determine the upload path. The `document` field should also be optional, allowing for blank entries.

The `new_document_filename` function should generate a unique filename for each uploaded document based on the user's ID and the current timestamp, ensuring that the filename does not exceed the maximum length. The filename should have the format `""userID_timestamp.ext""`, where `userID` is the user's ID, `timestamp` is the current UNIX timestamp, and `ext` is the original file extension.

A 3D printing company has a list of designs that need to be printed. The company uses a module named `printing_functions` which contains two functions: `print_models()` and `show_completed_models()`. The `print_models()` function simulates printing each design until none are left. Once a design is printed, it's moved to a list of completed models. The `show_completed_models()` function then displays the names of all the models that were printed.

Write a Python module named `printing_functions` that contains the following two functions:

1. `print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models)`: This function should simulate printing each design, one at a time, until there are no more designs to print. It should modify the `unprinted_designs` list and populate the `completed_models` list.

2. `show_completed_models(completed_models)`: This function should display the name of each model that was printed.

After implementing the module, demonstrate its functionality by using the provided lists `unprinted_designs` and `completed_models`. Ensure that the original list of unprinted designs is emptied and all the designs are moved to the completed models list after printing.

Write a Python function `rotate_text` that takes a string `text` and an integer `rotation` as its parameters and returns a new string where each letter in the original string is rotated by the given rotation amount through the alphabet. The rotation should maintain the case of the original letters (i.e., uppercase letters remain uppercase, and lowercase letters remain lowercase) and should leave non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

For example, with a rotation of 1, 'a' becomes 'b', 'z' becomes 'a', 'A' becomes 'B', and 'Z' becomes 'A'. The function should handle negative rotation values as well, which rotate the letters in the opposite direction.

Write a Python program that continuously monitors an RFID reader connected to a Raspberry Pi and logs the unique identifier (UID) of RFID tags that come into proximity with the reader. The program should also provide a function to stop the monitoring process gracefully when the user decides to terminate the program.

The program should adhere to the following requirements:

1. Use the `MFRC522` library to interact with the RFID reader.
2. Use the `RPi.GPIO` library for Raspberry Pi GPIO pin control.
3. The program should print a message to the console when an RFID tag is detected.
4. The UID of the detected RFID tag should be logged with a timestamp.
5. Provide a mechanism to stop the monitoring process safely without causing GPIO warnings or errors.
6. Include error handling for common issues that may arise during the RFID reading process.

Since this program interacts with hardware, the test cases would involve running the program and presenting RFID tags to the reader to ensure the following:

1. The program prints ""TAG Detectada!"" when a tag is in proximity.
2. The UID of the tag is logged with a timestamp.
3. Pressing Ctrl+C stops the program and cleans up the GPIO without errors.
4. The program handles errors gracefully and cleans up GPIO before exiting.

Design a Capsule Network for MNIST Classification

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits that is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. Your task is to implement a Capsule Network (CapsNet) that can classify these handwritten digits. The CapsNet should be able to learn spatial hierarchies between simple and complex objects in an image, which is a key advantage over traditional convolutional neural networks.

Your implementation should include the following components:
1. A data pipeline that reads MNIST data from CSV files, decodes it, and prepares it for training and validation.
2. A convolutional layer that extracts primary features from the input images.
3. A PrimaryCaps layer that converts scalar feature detectors into vector outputs.
4. A DigitCaps layer that performs dynamic routing between capsules.
5. A masking layer that masks out all but the activity vector of the correct digit capsule.
6. A loss function that uses the margin loss for digit existence.
7. An optimizer that minimizes the total loss.
8. Metrics to evaluate the model's accuracy.
9. A training loop that trains the model and evaluates it on the validation set after each epoch.
10. A summary writer that logs the loss and accuracy for visualization in TensorBoard.
11. A model saver that saves the trained model.

You should use TensorFlow to implement the Capsule Network and ensure that the code is well-documented with comments explaining each part of the network.

Design a benchmarking system for comparing the performance of various image filtering and convolution operations between CPU (using `scipy.ndimage`) and GPU (using `cupyx.scipy.ndimage`). The system should be able to handle different image shapes, filter sizes, and data types. The benchmark should include a variety of operations such as uniform filtering, Gaussian filtering, maximum/minimum filtering, median filtering, percentile filtering, rank filtering, and convolution/correlation in both 1D and multi-dimensional forms.

The benchmarking system should be implemented as two classes: `FilterBench` and `ConvolveBench`, both inheriting from a base class `ImageBench`. The `ImageBench` class should handle the common setup for the benchmarks, while `FilterBench` and `ConvolveBench` should specialize in setting up the arguments for filter and convolution operations, respectively.

The benchmarking should be run for a predefined set of image shapes, filter sizes, and modes, and the results should be collected into a pandas DataFrame. The results should then be saved to a CSV file, a pickle file, and a markdown file for easy viewing and analysis.

Design a Python function `predict_audio_class` that takes a pre-trained TensorFlow model and a path to a WAV audio file as input and predicts the class of the audio. The audio file should be processed using the following steps:

1. Read the WAV file from the given path.
2. Decode the WAV file into a tensor with a specified sampling rate.
3. Apply a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the audio tensor to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency domain.
4. Take the absolute value of the first half of the FFT, which represents the positive frequencies.
5. Use the pre-trained model to predict the class of the audio based on the FFT representation.
6. Return the predicted class as an integer.

The function should be robust and handle any errors that may occur during the file reading and processing stages. Assume that the pre-trained model has a `predict` method that takes a batch of data and returns a batch of predictions.

Write a Python AWS Lambda function that processes S3 object creation events. The function should be designed to be triggered by an AWS S3 event, which provides details about the created object in an S3 bucket. The function should retrieve the content of the newly created object, log the content for debugging purposes, and record a custom metric indicating the processing of an S3 object creation event.

The function should use AWS Lambda Powertools for logging, tracing, and metrics. The logger should log the event details and the content of the S3 object. The tracer should capture the Lambda handler's execution, and the metrics should record a custom metric named ""S3ObjectProcessed"" with a unit of count and a value of 1 for each invocation.

The function should return a dictionary containing the S3 object's content and the execution details from the event.

Design a system that generates a personalized set of questions for a student's exercise based on the course and exercise settings. The system should consider the following:
- The exercise settings, such as whether the questions should be shuffled, the types of questions to include, and any specific tags associated with the questions.
- The number of questions to draw for the exercise, which may be specified in the exercise settings.
- The student's previous answers, ensuring that questions already answered are not included in the new set.
- The system should be able to regenerate a set of questions if the student has partially completed the exercise, filling in the remaining questions up to the total specified in the exercise settings.

In this solution, we have created a simplified version of the `ExerciseSystem` class that handles the generation of questions for a student's exercise. The `generate_questions` method fetches the exercise settings, filters, and shuffles the questions if required, and then adds the exercise and questions to the student's record. The `filter_and_shuffle_questions` method is a helper function that performs the filtering and shuffling based on the exercise settings. The `add_student_exercise` method adds the generated questions to the student's exercise record in the database.

Please note that the actual implementation of the PostgreSQL class and its methods, as well as the database schema, are not provided here and are assumed to be available in the environment where this code would run.

Design a Django application model to represent a system where users have roles and permissions. Each user is identified by a unique DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad), a username, and a password. Users are assigned a single role, but each role can have multiple permissions. Permissions are simply identified by a name.

The system should have the following models:
- `Role`: Represents the role a user can have. It should have a `name` field.
- `Permission`: Represents the actions that can be performed within the system. It should have a `name` field.
- `UserRole`: Represents the many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Role`. A user can have only one role, but a role can have many users.
- `RolePermission`: Represents the many-to-many relationship between `Role` and `Permission`. A role can have multiple permissions.

The `User` model should be an extension of Django's built-in `AbstractBaseUser` and use Django's `UserManager`. The `User` model should override the `USERNAME_FIELD` to use the `dni` as the unique identifier for authentication.

Write the Django models to represent this system, ensuring that you include the necessary fields and relationships. Also, include a `__str__` method for each model to return a string representation of the instance, and a `get_role` method for the `User` model to return the user's role.

Write a Python program that extracts information about businesses from a JSON file containing a list of nested data structures. Each entry in the JSON file represents a business with various attributes. The program should parse the JSON file and extract the following information for each business:

- Store Name
- Tags (as a comma-separated string)
- Location (as a comma-separated string)
- URL
- Number of Reviews
- Average Reviews
- Features (as a comma-separated string)
- Region
- Phone Number
- Price Range

The JSON file is expected to have a specific structure where the business attributes are located at predefined indices within nested lists. If an attribute is not available, the program should handle this gracefully and assign `None` to that attribute.

The program should output the extracted information in a readable format and handle any exceptions that may occur during the extraction process.

Create a web application using Flask that allows users to interact with a database of advertising campaign records. The application should provide the following functionalities:

1. Insert new campaign records into the database through a web form.
2. Display all campaign records in a tabular format on a web page.
3. Generate and display a bar graph comparing the number of installs and purchases for each advertiser.
4. Generate and display a pie chart showing the distribution of total monthly expenses across the year.

The database table `csvrecords` contains the following columns: `sno`, `advertiserName`, `publisherName`, `impression`, `click`, `install`, `purchase`, `os`, `city`, `deviceBrand`.

The application should have the following routes:

- `/`: The home page that provides navigation to other functionalities.
- `/insert`: A page with a form to insert new campaign records into the database.
- `/table`: A page that displays all campaign records from the database in a table.
- `/barGraph`: A page that shows a bar graph comparing the number of installs and purchases for each advertiser.
- `/piechart`: A page that displays a pie chart of the total monthly expenses.

Write a Python program to scrape the top 100 movie rankings from a fictional movie rating website. The program should send a GET request to the website, parse the HTML content to extract movie details, and save the data in a JSON format. The movie details to be extracted include the movie's rank, cover image URL, title, main actors, release time, and rating.

The website's URL follows the pattern `http://fictional-movie-site.com/board/4?offset=OFFSET`, where `OFFSET` is a multiple of 10 that indicates the page number (e.g., 0 for the first page, 10 for the second page, and so on).

The HTML structure of the movie list is as follows (simplified for the purpose of this question):

```html
<dd>
    <i class=""board-index"">1</i>
    <img data-src=""http://example.com/image.jpg"" />
    <p class=""name""><a href=""/movie/1"">Movie Title</a></p>
    <p class=""star"">Main Actors: Actor1, Actor2</p>
    <p class=""releasetime"">Release Time: YYYY-MM-DD</p>
    <p class=""score"">
        <i class=""integer"">9</i>
        <i class=""fraction"">.5</i>
    </p>
</dd>
```

The program should include the following functions:

- `get_one_page(url, headers)`: Sends a GET request to the given URL with the specified headers and returns the HTML content if the response status is 200, otherwise returns `None`.
- `parse_one_page(html)`: Parses the HTML content and yields dictionaries containing the movie details.
- `write_to_file(content)`: Writes the given content to a file in JSON format. (This function is provided but commented out in the given code snippet.)
- `main(offset)`: Orchestrates the scraping process for a single page by constructing the URL with the given offset, calling `get_one_page` and `parse_one_page`, and then writing the results to a file.

The program should also include a main block that iterates over the necessary offsets to scrape the top 100 movies (assuming 10 movies per page).

You are tasked with managing a MongoDB database for a task management application. The application stores tasks in a collection named ""todos"" within a database called ""python_course"". Each task document can have various fields, but commonly includes ""title"", ""completed"", ""dueDate"", and ""priority"".

Write a Python script that connects to the MongoDB server, interacts with the ""todos"" collection, and performs the following operations:

1. List all collections in the ""python_course"" database.
2. Insert a new task with the title ""Learn Data Analysis"", marked as not completed, with a due date of ""2023-09-01"", and a priority level of 3.
3. Insert multiple tasks at once with varying fields, ensuring that each task has at least a ""title"" and ""completed"" status.
4. Find and print the first task in the ""todos"" collection.
5. Retrieve and print all tasks that are not completed and contain the word ""learn"" (case-insensitive) in the title. Only the ""title"" field should be returned for these tasks.
6. Create a text index on the ""title"" field to optimize searches.
7. Perform a text search for tasks containing the word ""python"" and print the results.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of each operation.

Write a Python program that converts an image to ASCII art. The program should take an image file as input and produce a text file that represents the image using ASCII characters. The ASCII art should approximate the grayscale representation of the image by mapping different shades of gray to specific ASCII characters.

The program should allow the user to specify the desired width and height of the ASCII art, and optionally, the output file name. If the output file name is not provided, the ASCII art should be saved to a default file named ""output.txt"".

The grayscale value of a pixel should be calculated using the formula:
`gray = int(0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b)`

The ASCII characters used to represent the grayscale should be mapped from darkest to lightest as follows:
`ascii_char = list(""$@%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/\|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,\""^`'. "")`

The program should be implemented with a command-line interface using `argparse` to parse the input file, output file, width, and height parameters.

This solution provides a complete Python program that converts an image to ASCII art based on the given code snippet. The program uses the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments and the `PIL` library to process the image.

Test cases are described in comments for verifying the solution's correctness.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python program that performs classification tasks on two different datasets: the Iris dataset and the Digits dataset. The program should include the following functionalities:

1. Load the Iris dataset and use the first two features for classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a test size of 20% and a random state of 42. Train the SVM classifier and calculate the accuracy on the test set. Print the accuracy in percentage format.

2. Visualize the training data points and the support vectors determined by the SVM classifier in a 2D scatter plot.

3. Load the Digits dataset and split it into training and testing sets with a test size of 50% and a random state of 42. Train an SVM classifier with different penalty parameters (C=0.1, C=1, C=1000) and a fixed gamma value of 0.001. Calculate and print the accuracy for each penalty parameter.

4. Display the first 10 images of the Digits dataset using matplotlib's `matshow` function.

Ensure that the program follows the guidelines provided, including importing all necessary packages, providing clear and self-contained code, and including test cases to verify the solution's correctness.

Design a simple menu system for a diner that allows clients to iterate over a collection of menu items. Each menu item consists of a name, description, and price. Implement the `MenuItem` class, the `Iterator` interface, and the `DinerMenuIterator` class that adheres to the `Iterator` interface.

The `Iterator` interface should have the following methods:
- `hasNext()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether there are more items to iterate over.
- `next()`: Returns the next item in the collection.
- `remove()`: Removes the last item returned by the iterator.

The `MenuItem` class should have the following attributes and methods:
- Attributes: `name`, `description`, `price`.
- A constructor that initializes the attributes.

The `DinerMenuIterator` class should implement the `Iterator` interface and provide functionality to iterate over a list of `MenuItem` objects.

Write a Python program that demonstrates the use of these classes. Your program should create a list of `MenuItem` objects, instantiate a `DinerMenuIterator` with this list, and use the iterator to print out the names and prices of the menu items. Additionally, demonstrate the use of the `remove()` method by removing an item from the collection and then printing the updated list of items.

The program should distribute the images into folders based on whether the trait value for each image is above or below a certain threshold, indicating a high or low range for that trait.

The personality traits are as follows: Warmth, Reasoning, Emotional Stability, Dominance, Liveliness, Rule Consciousness, Social Boldness, Sensitivity, Vigilance, Abstractedness, Privateness, Apprehension, Openness to Change, Self-Reliance, Perfectionism, and Tension.

The program should:
- Import the necessary data from JSON files containing the trait values and image identifiers for the training and validation datasets.
- Use the provided trait thresholds to determine the classification range for each trait.
- Copy the images into the appropriate classification folders, which are structured as follows:
  - `../dataset/classification/{train_or_validation}/{trait}/{range}/`
    - `{train_or_validation}` can be either 'train' or 'validation'.
    - `{trait}` is the name of the personality trait.
    - `{range}` is either 'high-range' or 'low-range', depending on the trait value.

Write a Python program that includes the following:
- A function to import the trait values and image identifiers from the JSON files.
- A function to extract the trait values into a list.
- A function to distribute the images into the classification folders based on the trait values and thresholds.
- Test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Write a Python program that continuously scans for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon signals and logs the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of specific beacons. The program should be able to handle multiple beacons, identify them by their unique identifiers, and send the data through a UART interface.

The program should perform the following tasks:
1. Initialize the Bluetooth interface for scanning BLE beacons.
2. Continuously scan for BLE beacons and parse the events to get the RSSI values.
3. Filter the RSSI values for a predefined set of beacons identified by their unique identifiers.
4. Send the RSSI values of the detected beacons through the UART interface in the format ""BeaconID:RSSI"".
5. Log the start-up, scanning status, and any errors to a log file.
6. Gracefully handle a keyboard interrupt to close the program and the UART port.

Assume the existence of a `beaconScanner` module with the following functions:
- `hci_le_set_scan_parameters(sock)`: Sets the scan parameters for the given Bluetooth socket.
- `hci_enable_le_scan(sock)`: Enables BLE scanning on the given Bluetooth socket.
- `parse_events(sock, loop_count)`: Parses BLE events from the given socket and returns a dictionary with beacon identifiers as keys and RSSI values as values.

Also, assume the existence of a `uart` module with the following functions:
- `sendData(data)`: Sends the given data string through the UART interface.
- `closeport()`: Closes the UART port.

**Test Cases**:

Since the actual Bluetooth scanning and UART communication cannot be tested in a simulated environment, we will assume that the `beaconScanner` and `uart` modules work as expected. The test cases would involve running the program in an environment with the specified beacons and checking the log file and UART output for the correct data.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a hypothetical fishery, the population of fish and the number of fishing boats are modeled using a system of differential equations. The fish population grows intrinsically but is harvested by the fishing boats, while the number of boats changes based on the profitability of fishing, which is a function of the fish population, the price of fish, and the cost of fishing.

The task is to simulate the dynamics of the fishery over time using the given parameters and differential equations. The simulation should plot the trajectory of the fish population and the number of boats over time, as well as the nullclines for the system. The nullclines are curves where the rate of change of fish or boats is zero, and they help to visualize the equilibrium points of the system.

The simulation should also calculate the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium point and determine the eigenvalues to analyze the stability of the system.

Design a Django web application for managing a recipe and meal planning platform. The application should allow users to perform the following actions:

1. View a random selection of recipes on the homepage.
2. Access a dashboard that displays the total number of recipes and meal plans, as well as details of the most recent plan.
3. List all recipes with pagination, sorted by votes and creation date.
4. List all meal plans with pagination, sorted by name.
5. Add new recipes with validation for required fields.
6. Edit existing recipes, allowing partial updates (i.e., not all fields need to be updated at once).
7. Add new meal plans with validation for required fields.
8. View details of a specific meal plan, including associated recipes.
9. View details of a specific recipe and allow users to vote on it.
10. Add recipes to a meal plan, selecting the day and meal number.

The application should use Django's class-based views and models to handle these functionalities. The provided code snippet includes examples of views and operations that can be used as a starting point for the application.

This solution provides a set of Django views that correspond to the functionalities described in the question. Each view is designed to handle a specific part of the recipe and meal planning platform, including displaying information, handling form submissions, and performing actions such as adding and editing recipes and meal plans. The views use Django's class-based views where appropriate and make use of Django's ORM to interact with the database. The solution also includes basic validation and error handling to ensure that the required fields are provided when adding or editing recipes and meal plans.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Django REST Framework API that allows users to manage social accounts, each associated with a specific city and kind. The API should provide endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete social accounts. Each social account should include a unique identifier, a style class, and foreign key relationships to a city and a kind.

The API should enforce the following constraints:
- A city must be represented by its name.
- A kind must be represented by its type.
- A social account's style class must be a string that represents the CSS class associated with the social account.

Implement the following serializers to handle the data representation and validation:
- `CitySerializer`: Serializes the city data.
- `KindSerializer`: Serializes the kind data.
- `SocialAccountSerializer`: Serializes the social account data, including the nested city and kind information.

Additionally, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the serializers' functionality.

In this solution, we have defined three serializers for the `City`, `Kind`, and `SocialAccount` models. The `SocialAccountSerializer` includes nested serialization for the related city and kind. We have also provided methods for creating and updating social account instances, taking into account the nested data for city and kind.

The test cases ensure that the serializers correctly handle creation and updating of social account instances, including the nested city and kind data.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Implement a reinforcement learning agent that can operate in a classification environment. The agent should be able to choose actions based on a policy derived from a neural network model and should support both deterministic and stochastic action selection strategies. The agent should also be capable of storing experiences in a replay buffer for future learning.

The classification environment (`ClassifyEnv`) is a custom environment that has a discrete action space and provides a state representation suitable for input into a neural network. The state is a tuple containing two elements: `input_id` and `attention_mask`, which are used by the neural network to make a classification decision.

The agent should be implemented with the following classes and methods:

1. `Agent`: A basic agent class that always returns a fixed action (e.g., 0).
2. `ValueAgent`: An agent that selects actions based on the value (Q-value) predicted by a neural network model. It should support epsilon-greedy action selection for exploration.
3. `PolicyAgent`: An agent that selects actions based on the probabilities output by a policy neural network model. It should sample actions according to the probability distribution.

Each agent should have a `step` method that performs an action in the environment, stores the transition in the replay buffer, and returns the reward and a flag indicating whether the episode has ended.

The `ReplayBuffer` class should be able to store and sample experiences, represented as `Transition` objects containing the state, action, reward, next state, and done flag.

Write a Python program that decodes a secret message from a series of geographical coordinates. The program should read an encoded text file containing geographical coordinates, where each coordinate is represented as a tuple `(latitude, longitude)` separated by a comma and enclosed in parentheses. The coordinates are separated by a `)` character. The program should use the OpenCage Geocode API to reverse geocode each coordinate to find the country associated with it. The first letter of each country's name will be used to form a secret message. The message should be enclosed in curly braces and prefixed with ""nactf{"".

For example, if the encoded text file `enc.txt` contains the following coordinates:
```
(48.8588443,2.2943506)(35.6894875,139.6917064)

Create a Python class `CodeExampleDirective` that extends the functionality of a Sphinx directive to include code examples in documentation. The directive should allow users to specify the programming language, the start and end markers within the source file to include, and the number of spaces to dedent from the beginning of each line. The directive should be registered in a Sphinx extension.

The class should follow these specifications:

1. The class should be named `CodeExampleDirective` and inherit from `LiteralInclude`, a directive provided by Sphinx for including code from external files.
2. The class should override the `run` method to set default options for `language`, `start-after`, `end-before`, and `dedent`. These options should be customizable through directive options in the documentation source.
3. The `setup` function should be defined to register the `CodeExampleDirective` with Sphinx under the directive name `code-example`.

The ""Inverse Captcha"" problem involves analyzing a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and finding the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

Write two functions to solve the Inverse Captcha problem:

1. `inverse_captcha(puzzle_input)`: This function takes a string `puzzle_input` representing the sequence of digits and returns the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. If there are no matches, it returns 0.

2. `inverse_captcha_skip(puzzle_input, skip)`: This function takes a string `puzzle_input` and an integer `skip` representing the number of positions to skip ahead for the comparison. It returns the sum of all digits that match the digit `skip` positions ahead in the list. The list is still considered circular for this comparison.

For example:
- `inverse_captcha(""1122"")` should return 3 because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.
- `inverse_captcha_skip(""123425"", 3)` should return 4 because the only match is between the first digit (1) and the fourth digit (4), which are 3 positions apart.

The service needs to be able to fetch web pages, convert timestamps between epoch and datetime, build URLs with parameters, and send email notifications. The provided code snippet contains functions that you need to integrate into a single Python module with additional improvements and error handling.

Your module should include the following functions:

1. `get_page(url)`: Fetches and returns the HTML content of a web page given its URL. The function should handle SSL certificate verification issues gracefully.

2. `epoch_to_datetime(seconds)`: Converts an epoch timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970) to a timezone-aware datetime object in UTC.

3. `datetime_to_epoch(timestamp)`: Converts a timezone-aware datetime object to an epoch timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970).

4. `get_UTC_now()`: Returns the current UTC time as a timezone-aware datetime object.

5. `build_URL(baseURL, params)`: Constructs a URL by replacing placeholders in the `baseURL` with the corresponding values from the `params` dictionary.

6. `send_email(subject, message, recipients, email_config)`: Sends an email with the given subject and message to the specified recipients. The `email_config` parameter should be a dictionary containing the necessary SMTP server configuration.

Write a Python function named `generate_within_bounds` that generates a list of random integer values within a specified range. The function should take three parameters: `count` (the number of values to generate), `min_value` (the minimum value, inclusive), and `max_value` (the maximum value, inclusive). The function should use the `random` module to generate random numbers.

However, to simulate potential errors in the random number generation process, the function should intentionally generate some numbers outside the specified range. If a number is generated that is outside the range, the function should raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating whether the generated number is above the maximum or below the minimum allowed value.

The function should catch these `ValueError` exceptions, print the error message, and continue generating numbers until the desired count of valid numbers within the range is reached. The function should return the list of valid numbers.

Design a Python program that simulates a simple job dependency system where jobs can depend on other jobs. A job is represented by a function, and dependencies are specified using a decorator `@job`. The decorator should take an optional argument that specifies the name of the job it depends on and a `desc` argument that describes the job.

The program should include the following features:
1. A decorator `@job` that can be used to decorate job functions. The decorator should store the dependencies and descriptions of the jobs.
2. A function `run_job` that takes the name of a job and runs it along with all its dependencies in the correct order (i.e., dependencies first).
3. A function `list_jobs` that prints out all the jobs with their descriptions and dependencies.

Assume that job names are unique and that there are no circular dependencies.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple load balancing scenario. The program should be able to take an integer `n` representing the number of servers and then take `n` integers representing the load on each server. The goal is to redistribute the load such that all servers have the same load if possible. The redistribution should only transfer load from servers with more load than the average to those with less, in the minimum number of moves possible.

The program should implement a class `LoadBalancer` with the following methods:
- `__init__(self, n: int)`: Initializes a new instance with `n` servers.
- `add_load(self)`: Takes `n` integers from the user input and stores them as the load on each server.
- `calculate_balance_moves(self) -> int`: Calculates and returns the minimum number of load units that need to be moved to balance the servers. If it's not possible to balance the servers, it returns `-1`.

The program should also have a `main()` function that repeatedly takes an integer input for the number of servers. If the input is `-1`, the program should terminate. Otherwise, it should create an instance of `LoadBalancer`, take the server loads as input, and print the result of the `calculate_balance_moves` method.

","

```python
import sys

class LoadBalancer:

    def __init__(self, n: int) -> None:
        self.n = n
        self.loads = []

        self.loads = [int(input()) for _ in range(self.n)]

    def calculate_balance_moves(self) -> int:
        total_load = sum(self.loads)
        if total_load % self.n != 0:
            return -1
        average_load = total_load // self.n

        for load in self.loads:
            if load < average_load:
                moves += average_load - load
        return moves

    while True:
        n = int(input())
        if n == -1:
            break
        balancer = LoadBalancer(n)
        balancer.add_load()
        print(balancer.calculate_balance_moves())

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

**Test Cases**:

To verify the solution's correctness, we can run the following test cases:

```python
# Test Case 1:
# Input:
# 3
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Output: 1

# Test Case 2:
# Input:
# 4
# 0
# 0
# 4
# 4
# Output: 4

# Test Case 3:
# Input:
# 3
# 1
# 2
# 5
# Output: -1 (because the total load is not divisible by the number of servers)

# Test Case 4:
# Input:
# 5
# 5
# 5
# 5
# 5
# 5
# Output: 0 (because all servers already have the same load)

# Test Case 5:
# Input:
# -1
# (This should terminate the program)
```

To run the test cases, you would normally run the `main()` function and input the values as specified in the test cases. However, since this is an interactive program, it's not possible to provide a script that automatically inputs these values into the standard input. Instead, you would manually input these values when prompted by the program.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program to solve a boundary value problem (BVP) for a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the finite difference method and the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for linear systems.

The BVP is defined as follows:

- The ODE to be solved is `-u''(x) + p(x) * u'(x) + q(x) * u(x) = r(x)` on the interval `[a, b]`.
- Boundary conditions are `u(a) = alpha` and `u(b) = beta`.
- The functions `p(x)`, `q(x)`, and `r(x)` are given as Python functions or lambdas.
- The interval `[a, b]` is divided into `n` equal subintervals, resulting in `n+1` grid points including the boundaries.

The program should implement the finite difference method to discretize the ODE and then use the Gauss-Seidel method to solve the resulting system of linear equations. The program should output the approximate solution `u(x)` at the grid points and the maximum error if the exact solution `y(x)` is known.

Write a Python module that provides functionality to resize images while maintaining their aspect ratio. The module should include a function to determine the scaling factor needed to resize an image to a given maximum width and height without distorting the aspect ratio. Additionally, the module should provide two functions to resize images using the Pillow library and OpenCV library, respectively. The resizing functions should return the resized image and the scaling factor used.

The module should include the following functions with the specified behavior:

1. `determine_scaling_aspect_ratio(image_height, image_width, max_height, max_width)`: This function takes the original image dimensions (`image_height`, `image_width`) and the maximum allowed dimensions (`max_height`, `max_width`). It should return the scaling factor needed to resize the image within the maximum dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio. If the image needs to be upscaled (i.e., the original dimensions are smaller than the maximum dimensions), the function should return `None`.

2. `resize_pillow_image(image, max_width, max_height)`: This function takes a Pillow `Image` object and the maximum allowed dimensions. It should resize the image using the Pillow library and return a tuple containing the resized `Image` object and the scaling factor used. If `max_width` or `max_height` is `None`, the original image should be returned without resizing.

Write a Python program that loads a dictionary of performance metrics from a file, processes the data, and generates a heatmap visualization comparing the performance of two different machine learning models across various configurations. The performance metric used is the Punzi significance improvement factor, which is a measure of how much better a model is compared to a baseline.

The program should follow these steps:

1. Load a dictionary from a pickle file that contains the Punzi significance improvement factor for two models (e.g., BDT and cut-based) across different mass and lifetime configurations of a hypothetical particle. The dictionary keys are strings in the format ""mass_lifetime"" (e.g., ""30_500""), and the values are dictionaries with keys 'impr' indicating the improvement factor.

2. Create a Pandas DataFrame from the loaded dictionary, where the rows represent different lifetimes and the columns represent different masses.

3. Generate a heatmap using Matplotlib to visualize the Punzi significance improvement factor for the BDT model over the cut-based model. The x-axis should represent different masses, the y-axis should represent different lifetimes, and the color intensity should represent the improvement factor.

4. Annotate the heatmap with the actual improvement factor values.

5. Save the heatmap to a PNG file with an appropriate filename that includes the training mass and lifetime.

6. Ensure that the code is well-documented with comments and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

You are tasked with creating a Django application that manages information about outlets for a retail company. Each outlet is uniquely identified by a UUID. The application should provide two main functionalities:

1. List all the outlets.
2. Retrieve the details of a specific outlet using its UUID.

Write a Django view class for each functionality:

- `OutletList` should be a class-based view that returns a JSON response with a list of all outlets. Each outlet in the list should be represented as a dictionary with at least the following keys: `id`, `name`, and `location`.
- `OutletDetail` should be a class-based view that returns a JSON response with the details of a single outlet specified by its UUID. The response should include the same keys as the `OutletList` view.

Additionally, define the URL patterns for these views using Django's `url` function. The URL pattern for the `OutletList` view should be the root URL, and the URL pattern for the `OutletDetail` view should capture a UUID as a URL parameter.

Write a Python function `average_gradients_across_workers` that averages the gradients of a neural network model's parameters across multiple workers in a distributed training environment using PyTorch's distributed package. The function should be designed to work with the Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training where multiple processes are used to train the same model on different subsets of the data.

The function should take a single argument:
- `model`: A PyTorch model that has been wrapped with `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`.

The function should perform an in-place all-reduce operation on the gradients of the model's parameters, summing them across all workers and then dividing by the total number of workers to obtain the average gradient. This is a crucial step in synchronized distributed training to ensure that all workers update their model parameters consistently.

Assume that the distributed environment has already been initialized and that the world size (total number of processes/workers) and the current rank (process identifier) can be obtained using `dist.get_world_size()` and `dist.get_rank()` respectively.

Include a docstring with the function that explains its purpose, arguments, and the expected environment setup.

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would typically need to set up a distributed environment, which is beyond the scope of this text-based interface.

Write a Python program that processes a string containing purchase information and writes the parsed data to an Excel file. The input string is in the format of key-value pairs separated by '&' characters, with keys such as 't' for timestamp, 's' for the sum of purchase, 'fn' for fiscal number, 'i' for invoice number, and 'fp' for fiscal sign, 'n' for number of items.

The program should include the following functionalities:
1. Check if the input data string has already been processed to avoid duplicates.
2. Parse the timestamp from the format 'yyyymmddThhmmss' to a more readable format 'dd.mm.yyyy' for the date and 'HH:MM:SS' for the time.
3. Extract and print the date of purchase, time of purchase, and sum of purchase.
4. Write the parsed data to an Excel file with columns for Date, Time, and Sum.

The program should handle any errors that occur during the parsing or writing process and inform the user accordingly.

You are tasked with creating a RESTful API for a blogging platform using Django REST Framework. The API should allow clients to perform CRUD operations on Posts, Comments, Groups, and Follow relationships between users. The API should be versioned, and the first version (v1) should be implemented.

The API should adhere to the following requirements:

1. Posts: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts.
2. Comments: Users can add comments to posts. Each comment is associated with a post and can be retrieved, updated, or deleted.
3. Groups: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete groups. A group can contain many users, and a user can be a part of many groups.
4. Follow: Users can follow or unfollow other users. A follow relationship should be able to be created and deleted.

The provided code snippet is a starting point for defining the URL routing for the API. You need to complete the implementation by writing the corresponding viewsets for `PostViewSet`, `CommentViewSet`, `GroupViewSet`, and `FollowViewSet`. Additionally, you should write test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.

Design a Python Flask application that serves as a user management system. The application should provide endpoints for user authentication (login, logout, register, refresh token), user information retrieval (get all users, get a single user), and user password update. The application should be structured using blueprints to organize these functionalities.

The endpoints should perform the following actions:

- `/auth/register`: Allows new users to register by providing a username, email, and password.
- `/auth/login`: Authenticates a user by their email and password, returning a session token.
- `/auth/logout`: Logs out a user by invalidating their session token.
- `/auth/refresh`: Refreshes a user's session token.
- `/user/all`: Retrieves a list of all registered users.
- `/user/<user_id>`: Retrieves details of a specific user by their user ID.
- `/user/update-password`: Allows a user to update their password.

Write the Flask application code with the necessary blueprints and routes. Ensure that each route has a placeholder function that simulates the intended behavior with a simple return statement. For example, the register route should return a message indicating that a user has been registered.

","

```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint, jsonify, request

# Create the Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define blueprints for different functionalities
auth_blueprint = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')
user_blueprint = Blueprint('user', __name__, url_prefix='/user')

# Define placeholder functions for each route
@auth_blueprint.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    # Simulate user registration
    return jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201

@auth_blueprint.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    # Simulate user login
    return jsonify({'message': 'User logged in', 'token': 'fake-token'}), 200

@auth_blueprint.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
def logout():
    # Simulate user logout
    return jsonify({'message': 'User logged out'}), 200

@auth_blueprint.route('/refresh', methods=['POST'])
def refresh_token():
    # Simulate token refresh
    return jsonify({'message': 'Token refreshed', 'new_token': 'new-fake-token'}), 200

@user_blueprint.route('/all', methods=['GET'])
def get_all_users():
    # Simulate retrieval of all users
    return jsonify({'users': ['user1', 'user2']}), 200

@user_blueprint.route('/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    # Simulate retrieval of a specific user
    return jsonify({'user': {'id': user_id, 'name': 'User {}'.format(user_id)}}), 200

@user_blueprint.route('/update-password', methods=['POST'])
def update_password():
    # Simulate password update
    return jsonify({'message': 'Password updated successfully'}), 200

# Register blueprints with the application
app.register_blueprint(auth_blueprint)
app.register_blueprint(user_blueprint)

# Run the application if this file is executed
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can run the Flask application and use tools like `curl` or Postman to send requests to the defined endpoints. Here are some example test cases:

```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/auth/register -d '{""username"":""testuser"", ""email"":""test@example.com"", ""password"":""password123""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json""

# Test user login

# Test user logout
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/auth/logout -d '{""token"":""fake-token""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json""

# Test token refresh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/auth/refresh -d '{""token"":""fake-token""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json""

# Test get all users
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/user/all

# Test get specific user
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/user/1

Write a Python function `lane_detection_preprocessing` that takes an image as input and returns a binary image where the likely regions of lane markings are highlighted. The function should perform several image processing steps to detect lines that are likely to be part of lane markings on a road. The steps include:

1. Converting the input image to grayscale.
2. Applying a Sobel operator in the x-direction to highlight vertical lines, which are common in lane markings.
3. Thresholding the result of the Sobel operator to create a binary image that retains only strong vertical lines.
4. Detecting white pixels that could be part of lane markings in the grayscale image.
5. Converting the image to the HLS color space and isolating the saturation channel.
6. Thresholding the saturation channel to detect areas with high saturation, which could indicate lane markings.
7. Isolating the hue channel in the HLS color space and thresholding it to detect yellow colors, which are often used in lane markings.
8. Combining all the binary images from the above steps to create a final binary image that highlights the likely lane markings.

The function should use OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations.

Write a Python function `find_amicable_pairs` that finds and returns all the amicable pairs of numbers up to a given limit `n`. An amicable pair consists of two numbers for which the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself.

For example, the numbers 220 and 284 are an amicable pair because:
- The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; their sum is 284.
- The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142; their sum is 220.

The function should use memoization to optimize the calculation of the sum of proper divisors for each number.

### Function Signature:
```python
def find_amicable_pairs(n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]: ...
```

### Example:
```python
print(find_amicable_pairs(10000))
# Output: [(220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368)]

Design a Python module named `secrets_manager` that provides functionality to interact with a secrets storage system. The module should include two primary functions: `write_secret` and `read_secret`. The `write_secret` function should store a secret value associated with a unique identifier, while the `read_secret` function should retrieve the secret value given its identifier.

The module should be designed to work with AWS Secrets Manager service, but for testing purposes, it should be compatible with the `moto` library, which mocks AWS services.

Write a Python function `compute_HBar_on_HF` that computes the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (H-bar) acting on a Hartree-Fock (HF) reference state. The function should take as input a Hamiltonian operator `H`, a cluster operator `T`, and a list of occupation strings `occ_strings` representing the HF state. The function should return a new state representing the result of H-bar acting on the HF state.

The Hamiltonian `H` and the cluster operator `T` can be either primitive functions or instances of the `operator_list` class. The `operator_list` class is a container for a list of operator sequences and their corresponding coefficients. The `operator_list` class has methods to update and combine coefficients, as well as to print its contents.

The function `compute_HBar_on_HF` should use the `omega0_ops` function to compute the nested commutators of H and T up to the fourth order, flatten the resulting list of operator lists using `flatten_operator_list`, and then apply each operator sequence to the HF state with the corresponding coefficient using `HBar_term_on_HF`. The results should be combined into a single state representing the action of H-bar on the HF state.

The function should also take an optional `resources` parameter, which is an instance of `qode.util.parallel.resources`, and an optional `textlog` parameter, which is a logging function. The `resources` parameter should be used to parallelize the computation across multiple cores, and the `textlog` function should be used to log the number of cores being used.

You are tasked with creating a machine learning model evaluation framework for a classification problem. The dataset contains a target variable named 'status_group' and several feature columns. The framework should allow for the evaluation of different models and feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

Write a Python program that implements the following functionalities:

1. A function `cv_evaluate` that performs cross-validation on a given model and dataset, with the option to include preprocessing transformers and hyperparameter tuning using randomized search. It should return the holdout set score, cross-validation scores, and the trained model.

2. A function `feature_engineering_pipeline` that iterates over a list of models and a list of potential transformers (feature engineering techniques). It should evaluate each model with and without each transformer, record the performance, and decide whether to accept or reject the transformer based on improvement in performance.

3. A function `create_pipelines` that constructs a list of pipelines from the accepted models and transformers, sorted by their performance score.

The program should include the necessary imports, and you should provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Write a Python function named `max_of_three` that takes three integer inputs and returns the maximum of the three numbers. If two or more numbers are equal and greater than the others, it should return the value of the equal numbers.

The function should follow these requirements:
- It should take exactly three arguments, all of which are integers.
- It should return an integer, which is the greatest of the three input numbers.

Additionally, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a class `KClosestElementsFinder` that finds the `k` closest elements to a given target in a sorted array. The class should implement a method `find_closest_elements` that takes a sorted array `arr`, a target value `target`, and an integer `k`, and returns a list of the `k` closest elements to the target in the array. The elements should be returned in ascending order. If there are two elements with the same difference to the target, the smaller element should be considered closer.

The solution should utilize a binary heap to efficiently find the `k` closest elements and should work in `O(log(n) + k*log(k))` time complexity, where `n` is the size of the input array.

Write a Python class `Trip` that models a road trip and calculates the average speed of the trip. The class should have the following specifications:

1. Private instance variables:
   - `__distance`: a non-negative float representing the distance of the trip in kilometers.
   - `__time`: a positive float representing the time taken for the trip in hours.

2. A constructor that takes `distance` and `time` as arguments and initializes the private instance variables. It should raise a `ValueError` if `distance` is negative or `time` is non-positive.

3. Getter and setter methods for `distance` and `time`:
   - `set_distance(self, distance)`: sets the `__distance` if the `distance` is non-negative.
   - `set_time(self, time)`: sets the `__time` if the `time` is positive.
   - `get_distance(self)`: returns the `__distance`.
   - `get_time(self)`: returns the `__time`.

4. A method `average_speed(self)` that calculates and returns the average speed of the trip as distance divided by time.

5. An overridden `__str__` method that returns a string in the format: ""Distance = {distance} km, Time = {time} h"".

Design a Python module that provides utilities for creating various types of cyber threat intelligence observables, which are entities representing technical artifacts such as domain names, IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes that are of interest in a cybersecurity context. The module should allow users to create observables with custom properties, such as a score indicating the threat level, labels for categorization, and references to the identity of the creator and any marking definitions applied to the observable.

The observables should be compliant with the STIX 2.0 (Structured Threat Information eXpression) standard, which is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence. The module should provide functions to create the following types of observables:

1. IPv4 Address
2. IPv6 Address
3. Domain Name
4. Hostname
5. URL
6. File (with MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 hashes, and file name)

Each function should accept a set of properties encapsulated in a `NamedTuple` called `ObservableProperties`, which includes the value of the observable, the identity of the creator, a list of labels, and a list of marking definitions. The module should also include a helper function to generate default custom properties for observables.

You are tasked with creating a Django application that manages student grades. The application should have a URL configuration that allows users to access different parts of the application through specific endpoints. The application should have the following URL patterns:

1. An admin interface accessible at the `/admin/` endpoint.
2. A grades section where all grade-related views are accessible at the root (`/`) endpoint.
3. A login section where all authentication-related views are accessible at the `/login/` endpoint.

The given code snippet is a starting point for the `urls.py` file in your Django project. Your task is to write a Python function `validate_urlpatterns(urlpatterns)` that takes the `urlpatterns` list as an argument and checks if it meets the following criteria:

- The `urlpatterns` list must contain three path configurations.
- The first path must be for the admin interface with the exact path 'admin/'.
- The second path must be for the grades section with the exact path '' (empty string for the root).
- The third path must be for the login section with the exact path 'login/'.
- Each path must include the corresponding URL configurations from the `grade.urls` module.

The function should return `True` if all criteria are met, otherwise, it should return `False`.

The test cases cover various scenarios, including typical Harshad numbers, non-Harshad numbers, a large number, an edge case (zero), and single-digit numbers.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `find_square_root_approximation` that approximates the square root of a non-negative number using a brute-force algorithm. The function should take three parameters:

1. `x` (float): The number for which the square root needs to be approximated.
2. `epsilon` (float): The precision of the approximation. The function should stop when the square of the current guess is within `epsilon` of `x`.
3. `step` (float): The increment by which the guess is increased during each iteration.

The function should return a tuple `(status, guess)` where `status` is a string that can either be `'succeeded'` or `'failed'`, indicating whether the approximation was successful within the given precision, and `guess` is the final approximation of the square root.

If the square of the guess exceeds `x` before the approximation is within the desired precision, the function should stop and return `'failed'` as the status.

This solution defines the function `find_square_root_approximation` and provides test cases to verify its correctness.

Write a Python function named `compare_values` that takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`. The function should compare the two integers and return a string that describes their relationship. The possible return strings are:

Design a Python class `MyDataset` that extends `torch.utils.data.Dataset` for facial landmark detection. The dataset should be able to load images, apply a series of transformations, and return the transformed image along with the processed facial landmarks and the corresponding label.

The transformations include:
1. Enlarging the bounding box around the face.
2. Random cropping within the enlarged bounding box.
3. Random horizontal flipping.
4. Random noise addition to the landmarks.
5. Skewing the image and adjusting the landmarks accordingly.
6. Rotating the image so that the line between the eyes is horizontal, and adjusting the landmarks accordingly.
7. Resizing the image to a fixed size and normalizing the landmark coordinates to this size.
8. Clipping the landmark coordinates to ensure they fall within a specified grid on the resized image.

The class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, imgs, labels, bboxs, landmarks, flag, transform=None, target_transform=None, loader=RGB_loader)`: Initializes the dataset with the given parameters.
- `__getitem__(self, index)`: Returns the transformed image, processed landmarks, and label for the given index.
- `__len__(self)`: Returns the length of the dataset.

Write a Python program to perform binary classification on the Iris dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels. The Iris dataset contains measurements for iris flowers of three different species. For this task, you will only use two of the three species, and two features (sepal length and sepal width) for the classification.

The program should:
- Load the Iris dataset and filter out one of the species so that only two remain for binary classification.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets, with 90% of the data used for training and the remaining 10% for testing.
- Normalize the features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- Train three different SVM classifiers with the 'linear', 'rbf', and 'poly' kernels.
- Visualize the decision boundaries of each classifier along with the training and test data points.
- Evaluate the accuracy of each classifier on the test set and print the results.

Use the given code snippet as a starting point for your program. Make sure to include all necessary imports and to define any additional functions if needed.

Design a Python program that simulates the creation of a road map for a driving simulation game. The program should be able to read a JSON file containing the map data and generate a `Map` object that consists of multiple `Road` objects, each containing multiple `Lane` objects.

1. The graph must be fully connected.
2. The maximum diameter of the graph (the longest shortest path between any two vertices) must be 4.

4. The total cost of the graph, defined as the sum of the Euclidean distances between connected nodes, must be minimized.

The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, and each node is assigned a unique pair of (x, y) coordinates. The Euclidean distance between two nodes is used as the weight of the edge connecting them.

The optimization algorithm should consist of two parts:
- A Greedy Local Search Algorithm that iteratively removes the most expensive edge and checks if the resulting graph still satisfies the constraints. If the new total cost is lower, it updates the graph.
- An Original Heuristic Algorithm that constructs a new graph by selecting edges with the minimum weight while ensuring that all constraints are met.

The program should output the coordinates of the nodes, the total cost of the graph before and after optimization, and the runtime of each optimization algorithm.

Write a Python function `calculate_bandwidth_overhead` that computes the bandwidth overhead introduced by a perturbation technique on network traffic data. The function should take two file paths as input: one for the original network traffic data and one for the perturbed network traffic data. Both files are in CSV format and contain network traffic data, where each row represents a sequence of packet sizes.

The function should use a utility function `load_csv_data` from a module `utils_wf` to load the data from the CSV files. The `load_csv_data` function returns two items: a list of packet size sequences (x) and their corresponding labels (y).

The bandwidth overhead is calculated as the absolute difference in the sum of absolute packet sizes between the original and perturbed data, divided by the sum of absolute packet sizes of the original data.

The function should return the bandwidth overhead as a float.

Write a Python script that cleans up a database by removing records associated with source IDs that are no longer active. The script should perform the following tasks:

1. Retrieve a list of active source IDs from a utility module.
2. Establish a database connection using a utility module.
3. Identify and delete records from specified tables where the source ID is not in the list of active source IDs.

The script should be designed to work with a legacy system, and it should use a utility module named `modules_legacy.utils` which provides two functions:

- `get_sources()`: Returns a dictionary where keys are active source IDs (as strings) and values are additional information about the sources.
- `get_dbconn()`: Returns a database connection object.

The script should iterate over a predefined list of table names and execute SQL DELETE statements to remove records with inactive source IDs. The script should print the SQL DELETE statements that would be executed.

Assume that the database connection object returned by `get_dbconn()` has a `cursor()` method that returns a cursor object supporting the `execute()` and `fetchall()` methods.

Design a Python program that simulates a simple text encryption and decryption service using a Caesar cipher and binary encoding. The program should be able to handle two types of requests: encrypting a given text using a Caesar cipher with a specified shift, and decrypting a given binary-encoded string back to text. The program should also handle large input validation and provide appropriate feedback.

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.

Binary encoding represents text as a sequence of binary numbers, where each character is converted to its corresponding binary ASCII value.

The program should include the following functionalities:
1. Encrypt a given text using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift.
2. Decrypt a given binary-encoded string back to text.
3. Validate that the input text for encryption does not exceed a certain length (e.g., 4096 characters).

Create a Python Django application that allows users to search for wallpapers from the Wallhaven website (https://wallhaven.cc/). The application should provide a form where users can enter a search phrase to find wallpapers related to that phrase or choose to get random wallpapers. The search results should be displayed as thumbnails on the same page without reloading the entire page (using AJAX). Each thumbnail should be encoded in base64 to be displayed directly in the HTML.

The application should consist of the following components:
1. A Django form (`WallpaperForm`) with fields for the search phrase and a boolean field to indicate whether the user wants random wallpapers.
2. A view function (`wallpaper`) that handles the form submission and returns a JSON response with the base64-encoded images if the request is made via AJAX, or renders the form on the page if it's a regular GET request.
3. A helper function (`convert_images`) that takes the search phrase and a boolean indicating random or not, fetches the images from Wallhaven, and returns a list of tuples with the image extension and base64-encoded data.
4. A template (`home.html`) that includes the form and a script to handle the AJAX submission and update the page with the search results.
5. A template (`search_results.html`) to render the base64-encoded images as thumbnails.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to set up a Django project with the given code and templates. Then, you can perform the following actions:

1. Access the home page and verify that the `WallpaperForm` is rendered correctly.
2. Submit the form with a search phrase and verify that the AJAX request returns a JSON response with the correct template containing base64-encoded images.
3. Submit the form to get random wallpapers and verify that the AJAX request returns a JSON response with the correct template containing base64-encoded images.
4. Test with invalid data or when Wallhaven is not reachable and verify that the application handles errors gracefully.

Please note that actual test cases would involve setting up a Django test client and using it to simulate GET and POST requests to the `wallpaper` view, checking the responses for correctness.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class `SessionsDAO` that interacts with a database to manage user sessions. The class should provide methods to check if a token exists, add a new session, and remove an existing session. The `SessionsDAO` class should inherit from a generic `DAO` class that handles common database operations. The `SessionsDAO` class should use PostgreSQL as the underlying database, and it should handle timezones correctly when storing session creation times.

The `SessionsDAO` class should implement the following methods:

- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the `SessionsDAO` instance, setting the table name to 'sessions' and a secret key for internal use.
- `isTokenExist(self, token)`: Checks if a session with the given token exists in the database.
- `add(self, user_id, duration, token)`: Adds a new session for a user with the given `user_id`, `duration` (in seconds), and `token`. If a session for the user already exists, it should update the existing session with the new `created_at` timestamp and `token`. The `created_at` timestamp should be stored in UTC.
- `remove(self, token)`: Removes the session with the given token from the database.

The `DAO` class is not provided, but you can assume it has a method `__perform_db_req__(self, query, params)` that executes a given SQL `query` with `params` against the database and returns the result.

Design a Python function named `add_target_and_features` that takes a DataFrame containing stock market data and performs the following operations:

1. Adds a new column named `NextDayPrice` that contains the next day's closing price.
2. Adds a new column named `PriceChange` that calculates the daily change in price as `(price on day t) - (price on day t+1)`.
3. Adds a new column named `Direction` that indicates whether the stock price will go up (`1`) or down (`-1`) on the next day.
4. Adds a new column named `PctChange` that calculates the percentage change in closing price from one day to the next.
5. Splits the data into training and testing sets based on the date range provided in the `train_test` function.
6. Applies Min-Max scaling to the training and testing sets separately for the columns `Close` and `Open`.

The function should return a dictionary with keys `scaler`, `train_df`, and `test_df`, where `scaler` is the fitted MinMaxScaler instance, `train_df` is the scaled training DataFrame, and `test_df` is the scaled testing DataFrame.

1. A database with the required tables (`actualizaciones_sociales_weekly` and `dolar_evolution`).
2. The `weekly_chart` directory with the `weekly.html` template file.
3. Mock functions or environment variables for `getConnection`, `send_post`, and AWS S3 client.
4. The `buffer` module with a `send_post` function that simulates posting to a social network.

Since setting up such an environment is beyond the scope of this platform, we will not provide specific test cases. However, you can test the function by running it in an appropriate environment and checking if the reports are generated, uploaded, and posted correctly.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class `PyTorchModelInterface` that serves as an interface to a trained PyTorch model for making predictions and handling model-related operations. The class should be able to load a model from a file, make predictions, and provide additional functionalities such as transforming input data if required, setting the model to evaluation mode, and determining the number of output nodes of the model.

The class should adhere to the following specifications:

1. The constructor should accept the following parameters:

    - `model_path`: A string representing the path to the trained model file. If the path is provided, the model should be loaded from this path.
    - `transformer`: An optional transformer object that has a `transform` method to preprocess input data. If `None`, no transformation is applied.

2. The class should have a method `load_model` that loads the model from the `model_path` if it is provided.

3. The class should have a method `predict` that accepts an input tensor and an optional boolean `transform_data`. If `transform_data` is `True`, the input tensor should be transformed using the transformer's `transform` method before making predictions.

4. The class should have a method `set_eval_mode` that sets the model to evaluation mode, which is necessary for making predictions.

5. The class should have a method `get_num_output_nodes` that accepts an integer `inp_size` representing the size of the input and returns the number of output nodes of the model.

6. The class should handle any exceptions that may occur during the operations, such as file not found errors when loading a model or method not implemented errors.

Design a RESTful API for managing ""leak"" information in a cybersecurity context. The API should allow users to create, retrieve, and delete leak information. The API should also handle different user roles and permissions, as well as common error scenarios.

The API should have the following endpoints:

1. `POST /api/v2/leak/general/`: Create a new leak entry. It requires a payload with a `url` and a `leak_id`. The response should include a status message and data about the created leak.

2. `GET /api/v2/leak/general/`: Retrieve a list of all leak entries. The response should include a status message and a list of leaks.

3. `GET /api/v2/leak/general/<leak_id>`: Retrieve a specific leak entry by its ID. The response should include a status message and data about the requested leak.

4. `DELETE /api/v2/leak/general/<leak_id>`: Delete a specific leak entry by its ID. The response should include a status message confirming the deletion.

The API should also handle the following error scenarios:

- Unauthorized access (401): When a user with incorrect or missing credentials tries to access the API.
- Missing parameters (400): When the required parameters are not provided in the request payload.
- Not found (404): When a leak entry with the specified ID does not exist.

Write a Python program that creates a communication channel between a parent process and its child process using a pipe. The parent process should read a message from a text file and send it to the child process through the pipe. The child process should receive the message and print it to the console. The message should be sent line by line.

The program should follow these steps:
1. The parent process opens a text file named ""content.txt"" and reads its contents line by line.
2. The parent process writes each line to the write end of the pipe.
3. The child process reads from the read end of the pipe and prints each line to the console.
4. Both processes should close their respective ends of the pipe after the communication is complete.
5. The child process should terminate after printing the message.

Ensure that the program handles the creation and closing of file descriptors properly and that it terminates the child process correctly.

Write a Python function `estimate_texture_flow_direction` that takes an image file path as input and returns a list of texture flow vectors estimated from the image. The function should use OpenCV's `cornerEigenValsAndVecs` function to estimate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of image blocks, which can be used to determine the predominant direction of texture flow.

The function should perform the following steps:
1. Read the image from the given file path.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of image blocks using `cv.cornerEigenValsAndVecs`.
4. Reshape the result to separate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
5. Estimate the texture flow direction based on the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
6. Sample the texture flow vectors at regular grid intervals.

Design a Django REST Framework API test suite for a password reset feature. The password reset process should include the following steps:

1. A user requests a password reset by submitting their email address.
2. The system generates a password reset link containing a unique user identifier (UID) and a token, which is sent to the user's email.
3. The user clicks the link, which directs them to a password reset confirmation page where they can enter a new password.

The test suite should verify the following scenarios:

- When a password reset is requested, an email with the correct reset link is sent to the user's email address.
- When the password reset link is visited, it should be valid and lead to a successful password reset confirmation page.
- When the new password is submitted with the correct UID and token, the password reset should be successful.

The test suite should include the following:

- Setup method to initialize the test client and issue a password reset request.
- Test case to confirm that the password reset email is sent with the correct link.
- Test case to confirm that visiting the reset link leads to a successful password reset confirmation page.
- Test case to confirm that submitting the new password with the correct UID and token successfully resets the password.

In this problem, you are tasked with recovering a secret flag from a series of encrypted messages. The encryption process uses a linear transformation based on a key that is generated from a timestamp. The key is a list of integers, and the encryption process can be represented as a matrix-vector multiplication. The goal is to find the correct timestamp offset (error) that was used to generate the keys, and then use this information to decrypt the messages and recover the flag.

The encryption process is as follows:
1. A key is generated for each message using the `gen_key` function, which takes a user ID (in this case, a timestamp) and the size of the key (n) as inputs. The function returns a list of `n` random integers, each in the range [0, 1024).
2. The key is used as a row in a matrix `A`, and the encrypted message is an integer `B`.
3. The system of linear equations `A * x = B` is solved to find the vector `x` that represents the decrypted message. The solution must satisfy the condition that all elements of `x` are in the range [-255, 255], excluding the last element.

The provided code snippet includes a function `solve` that attempts to find the solution `x` given the matrix `A` and the vector `B`. The function returns the decrypted message as a byte string if a solution is found, or `None` otherwise.

Your task is to complete the code to find the correct timestamp offset (error) and recover the flag. The `pays` list contains tuples of timestamps and encrypted messages. You need to iterate over a range of possible errors, construct the matrix `A` and vector `B`, and then use the `solve` function to attempt to decrypt the messages.

The city of Optima has a fleet of delivery trucks that all start from the central depot each morning. Due to recent fuel price hikes, the city wants to minimize the total fuel consumption of the fleet. The trucks have to visit various locations in the city, each identified by a unique integer coordinate. After analyzing the data, the city's analysts have determined that minimizing the total distance traveled by all trucks from the depot to their first stop will result in significant fuel savings.

Write a Python program that reads a list of integer coordinates from a file named ""sample_input.txt"", where each line contains a comma-separated list of integers. The program should calculate the median of these coordinates, which represents the optimal central starting point for the trucks. Then, it should calculate the total fuel consumption, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each coordinate and the median. The fuel consumption should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

The program should print two lines of output:
1. The median coordinate (rounded to the nearest whole number if necessary).
2. The total fuel consumption.

Write a Python function `convert_edge_list_format` that reads an edge list from a given input file path, processes each line according to specific rules, and writes the processed edge list to a given output file path. The function should follow these guidelines:

1. The input file is a tab-separated values (TSV) file where each line represents an edge in the format: `sequence_id_1`, `sequence_id_2`, `value`. The `sequence_id_1` and `sequence_id_2` are strings that represent unique identifiers for sequences, and `value` is a string that represents some associated value with the edge.

2. The output file should also be a TSV file with the same columns, but with the following modifications applied to each line of the input file:
    - If the last two characters of `sequence_id_1` or `sequence_id_2` are '-1', they should be removed.
    - If `sequence_id_1` or `sequence_id_2` is '000000000', it should be replaced with '000000001'.
    - If `sequence_id_1` or `sequence_id_2` is '000000001', the function should print 'FAIL' to the console and continue processing the next line.

3. The function should print the line number to the console every 10,000,000 lines processed to track progress, starting from 0.

4. The function should handle any file-related errors gracefully and print an appropriate error message to the console.

5. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Create a Python script that generates a changelog for a given version of the Apache Arrow project from its JIRA issues. The changelog should be formatted either for markdown or for the project's website, based on user input. The script should interact with the Apache JIRA instance to fetch the relevant issues.

The script should:
- Authenticate with the Apache JIRA instance using environment variables for the username and password.
- Fetch issues for a specified version that are resolved with a resolution of ""Fixed"" or ""Done"".
- Group issues by type for markdown output or by category for website output.
- Sort issues within each group by their key.
- Format the output as markdown or website HTML, depending on the user's choice.

The script should be executed from the command line with the following usage:
```
make_changelog.py $FIX_VERSION [$IS_WEBSITE]
```
Where `$FIX_VERSION` is the version of the project for which the changelog is being generated, and `$IS_WEBSITE` is an optional argument that, if set to '1', indicates that the output should be formatted for the website.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to set up the environment variables `JIRA_USERNAME` and `JIRA_PASSWORD`, and then run the script with a known fix version and check the output. Since this script interacts with an external service, the test cases would be manual and based on the actual output from the JIRA API.

For example:
```bash
export JIRA_USERNAME=your_username
export JIRA_PASSWORD=your_password
python make_changelog.py 1.0.0
```

You should see a markdown-formatted changelog for version 1.0.0 of the Apache Arrow project.

Design a chat bot module system that can be extended with various commands. The system should be able to handle different types of messages and commands from users. The given code snippet is a starting point for creating a `BotModule` class that can be extended to handle specific commands.

Your task is to create a subclass of `BotModule` called `EchoModule` that responds to a `.echo` command by sending back the same message to the user. The `EchoModule` should handle the command by implementing a method `handle_cmd_echo`. If the `.echo` command is followed by any text, the bot should respond with that text. If no text is provided, the bot should respond with a default message ""Echo: [user's nickname]"".

Additionally, write a simple `Connection` class that simulates the connection to a chat server and a `Bot` class that holds the nickname of the bot. The `Connection` class should have a method `msg_privmsg` that prints the message to the console, simulating sending a private message.

Provide test cases to verify that the `EchoModule` correctly handles the `.echo` command and responds appropriately.

Create a Python program using Pygame to simulate a dice roll animation. The program should display a graphical window with a single dice that the user can 'roll' by clicking and dragging the mouse. The dice should move according to the mouse movement and eventually come to a stop, displaying a randomly chosen face of the dice.

The dice should have the following behavior:
- When the user clicks on the dice, it should follow the mouse cursor as long as the mouse button is held down.
- When the mouse button is released, the dice should move with a velocity based on the speed of the mouse movement just before release.
- The dice should bounce off the window edges if it hits them.
- As the dice moves with velocity, it should rotate and show different dice faces.
- When the dice comes to a stop, it should settle on a random face and stop rotating.

The program should use the provided `Dice` class as a starting point, and you should complete the implementation by adding any necessary code and creating the main game loop. The dice images (`ID1`, `ID2`, `ID3`, `ID4`, `ID5`, `ID6`) should be loaded from image files.

Implement a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block in a neural network using Keras. The SE block is a type of architectural unit that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. This is achieved by squeezing global spatial information into a channel descriptor and then exciting the channels with this descriptor.

The SE block should be implemented as a function that takes an input tensor and a reduction ratio as parameters. The reduction ratio determines the bottleneck size in the SE block for the channel-wise feature recalibration.

The function should perform the following operations:
1. Apply global average pooling to the input tensor to squeeze spatial dimensions, resulting in a tensor with shape `(batch_size, channels)`.
2. Use a dense layer to reduce the number of channels by the reduction ratio, followed by a ReLU activation.
3. Use another dense layer to restore the number of channels to match the input tensor, followed by a sigmoid activation.
4. Reshape the output of the sigmoid activation to match the spatial dimensions of the input tensor.
5. Perform element-wise multiplication of the input tensor with the sigmoid activation output to recalibrate the channels.

Write the function `squeeze_excite_block` that implements the SE block and provide test cases to verify its correctness.

Write a function `find_diagonal_order` that takes a 2D list `matrix` of integers as input and returns a list of integers representing the elements of the matrix as they appear in a diagonal order traversal.

In a diagonal order traversal, we start from the top-left element and move diagonally up to the right. When the traversal reaches the boundary of the matrix, it wraps around to the next diagonal starting point, which is either the next row or column depending on the direction of the current diagonal. The direction of the diagonal alternates between moving up-right and down-left with each boundary hit.

Design a system that can verify the authenticity of a customer by running a series of checks (verifications). Each verification is a separate test that can pass or fail based on the customer's information. The system should aggregate the results of all verifications to determine if the customer is legitimate or potentially fraudulent.

The `Customer` class represents a customer with a unique identifier and personal information. The `Verification` class is an interface for different verification implementations. The `CustomerVerificationResult` class represents the result of the verification process for a customer, indicating whether they passed all verifications or failed.

Implement the `CustomerVerifier` class that can accept multiple `Verification` instances or a set of `Verification` instances upon initialization. The `verify` method should take a `Customer` object and run all the verifications on the customer's information. If the customer passes all verifications, the method should return a `CustomerVerificationResult` indicating a pass; otherwise, it should indicate a failure.

Given a sorted array of integers, write a function that creates a height-balanced binary search tree (BST) from the array. A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Implement the `Solution` class with the following method:

- `sortedArrayToBST(nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]`: Takes a sorted array of integers and returns the root node of the height-balanced BST.

Additionally, implement a helper function:

- `traverse_inorder(node: TreeNode) -> Generator[TreeNode, None, None]`: A generator function that yields the nodes of the BST in an inorder traversal.

The `TreeNode` class has already been defined for you, and you should use it to create the BST.

Write a Python program that uses the TinyDB database to track the first run of a bot and subsequent runs. The program should use a database file to store the timestamp of the first run and check whether the bot has been run before.

The program should include the following functionalities:

1. A function `check_first_run()` that checks if the bot is being run for the first time:
   - If it is the first run, the function should log a message ""This is the first bot run ever. Exciting!"" and store the current timestamp in the database under the key `first_run`.
   - If it is not the first run, the function should log a message ""Bot has run before"" and also log the timestamp of the first run.

2. The program should use a `TinyDB` database located at the path specified by `BASE_DIR` with the filename `db.json`.

3. The program should have a table named `dates` within the database to store the first run timestamp.

4. The program should use a custom logger to log messages. The logger should be imported from a module named `logger` and should have a method `info` for logging informational messages.

5. The program should handle the import of necessary modules and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the `check_first_run()` function.

from tinydb import TinyDB, Query
import os
import time

# Assuming the utils module provides a BASE_DIR constant
# For the purpose of this example, we'll define it here
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Assuming the logger module provides a log object with an info method
# For the purpose of this example, we'll define a simple logger here

    # Expected output:
    # INFO: Bot has run before
    # INFO: Bot first ran at timestamp: <timestamp_of_first_run>

In this solution, we have defined a `Logger` class and `BASE_DIR` for the sake of completeness, as they are assumed to be provided by external modules in the original problem statement.

Design a Python module named `congress_utils` that provides utility functions for interacting with a fictional Congress API. The module should include the following functionalities:

1. **CongressError**: A custom exception class for general Congress API errors. It should accept a message, an optional response object, and an optional URL where the error occurred.

2. **NotFound**: A subclass of `CongressError` specifically for items not found in the API.

3. **check_chamber**: A function that validates whether a given chamber is one of 'house', 'senate', or 'both'. It should raise a `TypeError` if the input is invalid.

4. **get_congress**: A function that calculates the Congress number based on a given year. The first Congress started in 1789, and a new Congress starts every two years. It should raise a `CongressError` if the year is before 1789.

5. **parse_date**: A function that parses a date string into a `datetime` object. It should use `dateutil.parser.parse` if available, otherwise fall back to `datetime.datetime.strptime`. It should handle both `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.date` objects as well.

6. **u**: A function that ensures a given text is returned as a Unicode string, replacing CRLF with LF line endings.

7. **get_offset**: A function that calculates the offset for pagination in the API. It assumes 20 items per page and should raise a `CongressError` if the page number is less than 1.

8. **CURRENT_CONGRESS**: A constant that holds the current Congress number based on the current year.

The module should include appropriate error handling and input validation. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of each function.

    - Customize the Django admin interface to manage these models.
    - Implement `EntryAdmin` and `RosterAdmin` classes to handle the custom logic for attendance entries and rosters.
    - `RosterAdmin` should have methods to generate a PDF report of the daily roster, calculate the number of days a trainee has been absent in the last 7 days, list unreported houses within the last 7 days, and send an email with the roster to admins.

3. **PDF Generation**:
    - Implement a function to generate a PDF report of the daily roster using the `render_to_pdf` function (from a hypothetical `pdf` module).

4. **Email Notification**:
    - Implement a function to send an email with the daily roster to admin email addresses configured in Django settings.

5. **URLs**:
    - Define custom URLs for generating the PDF report and sending the email notification.

6. **Test Cases**:
    - Write test cases to verify the correctness of the PDF generation and email sending functionalities.

You are tasked with creating a RESTful API using FastAPI that allows users to manage their bank accounts. The API should provide endpoints to perform the following actions:

1. Check the server status by pinging it.
2. Retrieve account balance for a given account ID.
3. Deposit a specified amount into an account.
4. Withdraw a specified amount from an account.

The account data will be stored in-memory for simplicity, using a dictionary where the key is the account ID and the value is the account balance.

The API should have the following endpoints:

- `GET /ping/`: Returns a JSON response `{""ping"": ""pong""}` to indicate that the server is running.
- `GET /account/{account_id}/`: Returns the balance of the specified account ID.
- `POST /account/{account_id}/deposit/`: Accepts a JSON payload `{""amount"": float}` and deposits the specified amount into the account.
- `POST /account/{account_id}/withdraw/`: Accepts a JSON payload `{""amount"": float}` and withdraws the specified amount from the account.

For simplicity, assume that:
- Account IDs are integers.
- The initial balance for any new account is 0.
- Deposits and withdrawals will not result in negative balances.

Write the FastAPI application code and include test cases to verify the correctness of each endpoint.

Write a function `top_k_frequent_elements` that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, and returns a list of the `k` most frequent elements in `nums`. If there are multiple elements with the same frequency, the order in which they appear in the output list does not matter.

The function should have the following signature:
```python
def top_k_frequent_elements(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    pass
```

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in nums]`.
- It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words, the set of the top `k` frequent elements is unique.

In this solution, we use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the input list `nums`. We then use the `most_common` method to get the `k` most common elements. The `most_common` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element and its frequency, sorted by frequency in descending order. We extract the elements from these tuples to form the final response list. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the solution.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a library management system with the following requirements:

1. The system should be able to manage books, authors, clients, and a library.
2. Each `Person` has a first name and a last name.
3. An `Author` is a `Person` who has a list of works (`oeuvre`) and can write new books.
4. A `Book` has a title.
5. A `Client` is a `Person` who has a collection of books.
6. A `Library` has a name and a catalog of books with their quantities.
7. The `Library` should be able to purchase books from an `Author`. If the book exists in the author's works, it should be added to the library's catalog with the specified quantity.
8. The `Library` should be able to lend books to a `Client`. If the book exists and is in stock, it should be added to the client's collection and the stock should be updated.
9. The `Library` should be able to perform an inventory, listing the quantities of each book in the catalog.

Design a statistical experiment to determine if a new website design (Version B) is more effective than the current design (Version A) in terms of user engagement. The effectiveness is measured by the success rate, which is the proportion of users who complete a desired action (e.g., signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase). You are provided with the probability of showing version A (`pa`), the probability of success for both versions (`q`), and the number of trials (`n`).

Write a Python function `calculate_low_points` that takes a 2D list `heightmap` representing a heightmap of a terrain, where each element is an integer representing the height at that location. The function should calculate the sum of the heights of all ""low points"" in the heightmap.

A ""low point"" is defined as a location in the heightmap that is lower than any of its adjacent locations (up, down, left, or right). If a location is on the edge or corner of the map, it only needs to be lower than its existing adjacent locations. Diagonal locations are not considered adjacent.

The function should return the sum of the heights of all the low points.

Write a Python program that generates a visual representation of two pipes with varying colors based on the contents of a text file. The text file, named `pipe.txt`, contains a sequence of characters where each character represents a color in a specific position of the pipes. The characters are as follows:

- 'm' for medium green
- 'l' for light green
- 'g' for green
- 'd' for dark green
- 'b' for black
- 'e' for empty space (no color)
- '\n' for a new line, indicating the end of the current row

The pipes have a defined width and height, and the colors should be displayed within these boundaries. The program should read the `pipe.txt` file and output a series of conditional statements that simulate the rendering of the pipes on a screen.

Write a Python function `selection_sort_descending` that sorts a list of integers in descending order using the selection sort algorithm. The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the maximum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning of the sorted part.

The function should take a single parameter:
- `arr` (List[int]): A list of integers that needs to be sorted.

The function should modify the list in place and does not need to return anything.

Additionally, provide test cases to demonstrate that the function works correctly.

In this solution, we have modified the original selection sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order by finding the maximum element in each iteration instead of the minimum.

In a medical data analysis pipeline, it is crucial to ensure that data integrity is maintained throughout various transformation steps. One such step involves splitting age groups into more granular categories and assigning custom weights to different records based on demographic information. The following functions are designed to test the integrity of the data before and after such transformations.

Write a Python program that includes the following functions:

1. `test_weights(pre_merge_df, post_merge_df)`: This function checks that no data records are lost during the process of merging with custom weights. It takes two pandas DataFrames as input: `pre_merge_df` before the merge and `post_merge_df` after the merge. The function raises an assertion error if the length of `post_merge_df` is less than `pre_merge_df`.

2. `test_split_age(input_df, output_df, metric)`: This function ensures that all unique observations in the `input_df` are present in the `output_df` after splitting age groups. It also checks that the number of entries remains the same after the split. The function raises an assertion error if any observation is lost or if the entry count changes.

3. `compare_pre_post_split(df, input_df, metric)`: This function compares the sum of a specified metric before and after the split to ensure that the total values are aligned. It takes a DataFrame `df` representing the post-split data, `input_df` as the pre-split data, and a `metric` which is the column name of the metric to be compared. The function raises an assertion error if the difference between the pre-split and post-split totals exceeds 0.1% of the pre-split total.

Implement these functions and provide test cases to verify their correctness.

You are tasked with creating a Python script to process a collection of JSON files containing candidate profiles. Each profile includes a list of skills along with the years of experience in each skill. The script should perform the following tasks:

1. Normalize the text data within the JSON files.
2. Assign a unique candidate ID to each candidate profile.
3. Extract and count the frequency of each skill across all profiles.
4. Extract and count the frequency of each skill within each job category.
5. Identify and extract the years of experience associated with each skill.
6. Write the updated candidate profiles back to the JSON files.
7. Ensure that the skills and job categories are stored in a way that allows for easy retrieval and analysis.

The script should handle any non-ASCII characters and normalize the text data to a consistent form. It should also handle any newline characters and Unicode escape sequences within the JSON data.

The script should be robust, efficient, and should include error checking to ensure that the number of skills matches the number of years of experience extracted for each candidate.

After processing, the script should invoke a separate module (`merge_ids_duplicates`) to merge any duplicate candidate IDs.

Design a class `FirstFollowSet` that maintains the first and follow sets for a context-free grammar. The class should be able to handle the addition and removal of grammar tokens to the sets, as well as provide a way to retrieve the set associated with a given key. The class should also track if any modifications have been made to the data since the last reset.

The `FirstFollowSet` class should have the following features:
- A dictionary to hold the first and follow sets, where the key is a tuple of `GrammarToken` objects representing a word in the grammar, and the value is a set of `GrammarToken` objects.
- A boolean flag `dirty` that indicates whether the data has been modified.
- Methods to add tokens to a set (`add`), create an empty set if not present (`add_empty`), remove tokens from a set (`remove`), and retrieve a set (`get`).
- The class should be able to handle keys and values that are single `GrammarToken` objects, lists of `GrammarToken` objects, or sets of `GrammarToken` objects.
- A `__str__` method to provide a string representation of the first and follow sets.

The `GrammarToken` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and is used to represent individual grammar elements.

Write a Python function `create_wsgi_application` that takes two arguments: `settings_module` (a string representing the settings module in the format 'my_project.settings') and `django_version` (a string representing the version of Django, e.g., '3.2'). The function should return a WSGI application callable for the specified Django project.

The function should perform the following steps:
1. Set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to the provided `settings_module`.
2. Depending on the `django_version`, import the appropriate `get_wsgi_application` function from `django.core.wsgi`.
3. Call the `get_wsgi_application` function to get the WSGI application callable.
4. Return the WSGI application callable.

Write a Python function named `flatten_list` that takes a single argument, which is a list that may contain nested lists up to one level deep. The function should return a new list with all the elements from the input list and its nested lists, if any, in the same order but flattened to a single level.

For example:
- If the input is `[1, [2, 3], 4]`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- If the input is `[['a', 'b'], 'c', ['d']]`, the output should be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.

The function should handle all types of elements within the lists, including integers, strings, booleans, and other objects.

Write a Python program that uses the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library to parse and evaluate simple arithmetic expressions. The program should be able to handle integers, decimals, and basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. The expressions can also include parentheses for grouping.

The input to the program will be a text file named ""entrada.txt"" containing one or more arithmetic expressions, each terminated by a semicolon. Each expression should be evaluated, and the result should be printed to the console. The program should also handle lexical and syntax errors by printing appropriate error messages.

For example, if ""entrada.txt"" contains the following:
```
Evaluar [3 + 4.5 * 2];
Evaluar [10 / (2 + 3)];

Implement a Python function `compare_clustering_algorithms` that compares the performance of two clustering algorithms, Power Ratio Cut (PRcut) and Ratio Cut (Rcut), on a synthetic dataset generated by the `make_circles` function from `sklearn.datasets`. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Generate a synthetic dataset with two concentric circles using `make_circles`, where the number of samples, the scale factor between the circles, and the noise level can be specified as parameters.
2. Construct a k-nearest neighbors graph from the dataset, with the number of neighbors as a parameter. The edge weights should be computed using a Gaussian kernel of the distances, normalized by the standard deviation of the distances.
3. Apply the Power Ratio Cut (PRcut) algorithm to the graph to obtain the first clustering result.
4. Apply the Ratio Cut (Rcut) algorithm to the graph to obtain the second clustering result.
5. Use the `k_means` function from `sklearn.cluster` to assign cluster labels based on the embeddings obtained from PRcut and Rcut.
6. Return the cluster labels from both PRcut and Rcut, along with the execution time for each algorithm.

The function should have the following signature:

```python

You are tasked with developing a Python script to train a machine learning model for predicting the ""Pawpularity"" of pet photos, a metric indicating the popularity of pet images on a social platform. The dataset consists of images and their corresponding Pawpularity scores. The goal is to use K-Fold cross-validation to train and evaluate the model's performance.

The script should perform the following steps:

1. Seed the random number generator for reproducibility.
2. Load the dataset from a CSV file named 'train.csv', which contains two columns: 'Id' for image identifiers and 'Pawpularity' for the popularity scores.
3. Split the dataset into K folds for cross-validation, ensuring that each fold has a stratified distribution of Pawpularity scores.
4. For each fold, initialize the data module and the model, and train the model using PyTorch Lightning with early stopping and model checkpointing based on validation RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
5. Log training progress and validation RMSE to TensorBoard.
6. After training on all folds, calculate the cross-validation RMSE score by averaging the best RMSE scores from each fold.
7. Print the cross-validation RMSE score.

Assumptions:
- The `PawpularityDataModule` class is available and handles the creation of PyTorch data loaders for training and validation sets.
- The `Model` class is a PyTorch Lightning module that defines the machine learning model and training steps.
- The necessary PyTorch Lightning and other libraries are installed.

**Test Cases**:

Since the solution involves training a machine learning model, the test cases would be the actual execution of the script with a dataset.

The script should be run in an environment where the necessary libraries and classes (`PawpularityDataModule` and `Model`) are available.

Write a Python class `DeviceDiscoveryManager` that manages the discovery of devices connected to a system. The class should provide two methods:

2. `wait_for_device_with_serial(serial, timeout)`: This method takes a serial number and a timeout value in seconds as arguments.

Write a Python function named `extract_issn` that extracts all valid ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) codes from a given text. An ISSN is an 8-digit code used to identify newspapers, journals, magazines, and periodicals of all kinds and on all media–print and electronic. The ISSN is divided into two four-digit numbers separated by a hyphen. The last digit of an ISSN can be an 'X', which represents the value '10' (used in a modulo 11 check digit scheme).

The function should adhere to the following requirements:

1. The function should take a single argument `text`, which is a string containing the text from which ISSNs should be extracted.
2. The function should return a generator that yields `Identifier` objects. Each `Identifier` object has two attributes: `type`, which is a string that should be set to `'issn'`, and `value`, which is the ISSN extracted from the text without the hyphen.
3. The function should be able to recognize ISSNs that are prefixed by the string 'issn', optionally followed by an equal sign and optional whitespace. For example, it should match 'issn 1234-5678', 'ISSN=1234-5678', and 'issn= 1234-567X'.
4. The function should ignore case when searching for the 'issn' prefix.
5. The function should use regular expressions to find ISSNs in the text.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple load balancer using asynchronous programming. The load balancer will manage a set of ""servers"" that each take a certain amount of time to process a ""request"". The time each server takes to process a request is simulated by the `wait_random` function provided in the code snippet, which represents a server that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` seconds.

The load balancer should implement the following functionality:

1. It should have a method `handle_request` that simulates sending a request to the server with the shortest expected delay time. If all servers are expected to be busy, it should wait for the one that will be available the soonest.
2. It should keep track of the number of active requests on each server.
3. It should print the server's ID and the delay time each time a server starts processing a request.
4. It should print the server's ID and the delay time each time a server finishes processing a request.

The program should simulate a scenario where a series of requests are sent to the load balancer, and it should print the activity as described above.

In this solution, the `LoadBalancer` class is responsible for managing the servers and dispatching requests to them. The `handle_request` method simulates processing a request by a server, and the `dispatch_requests` method is responsible for assigning incoming requests to the appropriate server based on the current load. The `main` function sets up the simulation with a specific number of servers and requests and then runs the load balancer.

Please note that the `wait_random` function from the given code snippet should be saved in a separate file named `wait_random.py` for the above code to work. Alternatively, you can include the `wait_random` function directly in the solution code above.",Python,McEval-Instruct

For example, if the database has a state named ""California"" with cities ""Los Angeles"", ""San Francisco"", and ""San Diego"", running the script with the arguments for a user with access to the database should print:

```
Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego

If an incorrect state name is provided or there are no cities for the given state, the script should print nothing. If there is a database connection error, the script should print the error message.",Python,McEval-Instruct

- `load_plugins()`: Attempts to import plugins from predefined modules and stores the successfully loaded plugins in a dictionary.
- `list_plugins()`: Returns a list of the names of all successfully loaded plugins.

Write a function `find_outlier` that identifies the outlier in a list of integers. An outlier is defined as the single integer in the list that is either odd when all other integers are even, or even when all other integers are odd. The list will always have a length of at least 3 and can be very large. The function should return the outlier integer.

Write a Python program to find the root of the function `f(x) = a * x + b * sin(x) - c` using the bisection method with high precision. The function `sin(x)` should be computed using its Taylor series expansion, and the precision of the calculations should be set to at least 130 decimal places using the `decimal` module.

The program should take three `decimal.Decimal` values `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, which represent the coefficients of the function `f(x)`. The root of the function is the value of `x` for which `f(x) = 0`. The search for the root should be conducted within the range [0, 2000002.0].

The output should be the root of the function, printed with a precision of 19 decimal places.

The `MockTestRunner` should provide methods to:
- Add tests to the runner with their expected results (text, image checksum, or audio data).
- Run all added tests and return a summary of the results, including the number of passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- Output detailed results for each test, including the test name, the expected result, the actual result, and a pass/fail indication.

- Draw a rectangle around the tracked object in each frame.
- Draw the path of the object as it moves through the frames.
- Calculate the distance between the center of the tracked object and the predefined goal point.

Create a Python program using the Pygame library that simulates a simple animation of a runner character. The runner character should be represented by a sprite that cycles through a series of images to create the illusion of running. The sprite images are assumed to be arranged in a single row on a sprite sheet image file named 'runnersprite.png'.

The program should implement a `Runner` class that extends the `Sprite` class from Pygame. The `Runner` class should have the following features:

1. The constructor (`__init__` method) should initialize the sprite with the following attributes:
   - `sprite_image`: a string representing the file path to the sprite sheet image.
   - `sprite_width`: an integer representing the width of a single sprite frame.
   - `sprite_height`: an integer representing the height of a single sprite frame.
   - `sprite_sheet`: a Pygame surface loaded from `sprite_image`.
   - `sprite_columns`: an integer representing the number of frames in the sprite sheet.
   - `current_frame`: an integer representing the current frame to be displayed.
   - `image`: a Pygame surface representing the current frame of the sprite.
   - `rect`: a Pygame rectangle representing the position and size of the sprite.

2. The `update` method should increment the `current_frame` attribute and loop back to the first frame after reaching the last frame. It should also update the `image` attribute with the new frame from the sprite sheet.

3. The sprite should have a transparent color key set to the color `(255, 0, 255)`.

The program should also include a main loop that creates a Pygame window, initializes a `Runner` instance, and updates and redraws the runner sprite at a consistent frame rate.

Write a Python function `contains_whitespace` that checks if the given iterable (string, list, or tuple) contains any element that is composed entirely of whitespace characters. The function should return a list of boolean values corresponding to each element, where `True` indicates that the element contains only whitespace characters, and `False` indicates that it does not.

Whitespace characters are any characters that are used to format text in a way that is typically not visible, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Function Signature:
```python
def contains_whitespace(iterable: Union[str, list, tuple]) -> List[bool]:
    pass

### Constraints:
- The input iterable can be a string, list, or tuple.
- If the input is a string, treat each character in the string as an element.
- If the input is a list or tuple, it can contain elements of any type. However, the function should only check for whitespace in elements that are strings.

### Example Test Cases:
```python
print(contains_whitespace(""hello world""))  # Output: [False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False]
print(contains_whitespace([""hello"", "" "", ""world""]))  # Output: [False, True, False]

Write a Python script that interacts with a hypothetical Crowdin API to retrieve and display a list of all source file paths in a project. The script should use the Crowdin API to fetch project information in XML format, parse the XML to extract file paths, and print them to the console.

The script should define two functions:

1. `get_project_info()`: This function should simulate an API call to Crowdin to get project information in XML format. For the purpose of this exercise, you can assume that the function returns a pre-defined XML structure as an `lxml.etree` object.

2. `process_item(item, parent_path=""/"")`: This function should take an XML element representing a file or folder node and a string representing the parent path. It should return a list of paths to all source files under the given node. If the node is a file, it should return a list containing the single path to that file. If the node is a folder, it should recursively process all child nodes and return a list of paths to all files within that folder.

The script should then use these functions to print a list of all source file paths in the project to the console.

Implement a `Queue` using a linked list in Python. The queue should support the following operations:

1. `enqueue(data)`: Add an element to the end of the queue.
2. `dequeue()`: Remove the element from the front of the queue and return it. If the queue is empty, return `None`.
3. `peek()`: Return the element at the front of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, return `None`.
4. `is_empty()`: Return `True` if the queue is empty, otherwise `False`.
5. `show()`: Print all elements in the queue from front to back.

Each element in the queue should be a `QueueNode` object, which is defined in the `queue_node` module. The `QueueNode` class has the following methods:

- `__init__(data)`: Initialize a new node with the given data.
- `getData()`: Return the data stored in the node.
- `getNext()`: Return the next node in the linked list.
- `setNext(next_node)`: Set the next node in the linked list.

You are given a file named `day1-input.txt` that contains a list of integer depth measurements, one per line. Your task is to analyze these measurements to count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.

Part 1:
Write a function `count_increases` that takes a filename as its argument, reads the integer values from the file, and returns the count of times the depth increases from the previous measurement.

Part 2:
Instead of considering each measurement individually, you need to consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. Write a function `count_window_increases` that takes a filename as its argument, reads the integer values from the file, and returns the count of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum.

1. `python file_digest_comparer.py file1.txt` - This should print the MD5 and SHA1 digests of `file1.txt`.
2. `python file_digest_comparer.py file1.txt file2.txt` - This should print the digests of both files and state that they are identical if the contents are the same.
3. `python file_digest_comparer.py file1.txt file3.txt` - This should print the digests of both files and state that they are not identical if the contents are different.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class `MysqlManager` that encapsulates the functionality to interact with a MySQL database. The class should provide methods to create a database, create a table within a database, insert records into a table, and commit changes to the database. The class should handle any exceptions that occur during database operations and print appropriate error messages. Additionally, the class should ensure that the database connection is properly closed when the object is no longer in use.

The class should follow these specifications:

1. The constructor (`__init__`) should accept parameters for the database endpoint, username, and password. It should establish a connection to the MySQL server and create a cursor object for executing SQL statements.

2. The `create_database` method should accept the name of the database to be created. It should check if the database already exists and create it only if it does not exist. If the database already exists, it should print a message indicating so.

3. The `create_table` method should accept the name of the table and the table schema (a string defining the columns and their data types). It should create the table within the currently selected database.

4. The `insert` method should accept an SQL insert command as a string and execute it to insert a record into a table.

5. The `commit` method should commit the current transaction to the database.

6. The class should have a `__exit__` method to ensure that the database connection and cursor are closed when the object is destroyed or when exiting a context manager block.

7. Include error handling for any exceptions that may occur during database operations, and print user-friendly error messages.

Write a Python program that implements a simple logging system using a fictional `flopi` module. The logging system should allow for different loggers to be created, each with its own logging level. The logging levels are `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`. The logger should only output messages that are at or above its set logging level.

The program should include the following functionalities:
1. A function `set_logging_level_for(logger_name, level)` that sets the logging level for a specific logger identified by `logger_name`. If `logger_name` is not provided, the default logger's level should be set.
2. A function `get_logger(logger_name)` that retrieves a logger object. If `logger_name` is not provided, the default logger should be returned.
3. Each logger object should have methods `info(message, end=""\n"")`, `warning(message, end=""\n"")`, and `error(message, end=""\n"")` to log messages at the respective levels. The `end` parameter should determine the end character after the message is logged (default is a newline).

The `flopi` module is not a real Python module, so for the purpose of this question, you will need to implement the necessary parts of the `flopi` module within your program to simulate the described behavior.

In the example usage, the default logger `log` is set to the default level `INFO`, so it prints all messages. The logger `log2` is set to `WARNING`, so it only prints messages that are `WARNING` or `ERROR` level. The message ""infoa"" is not printed because its level is `INFO`, which is below the set level of `WARNING` for `log2`.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python Flask application that provides statistical analysis services for numerical data samples. The application should expose a RESTful API that allows users to perform various statistical tests and calculations on their data samples. The API should support the following endpoints:

1. `/ztest`: Perform a Z-test on one or two samples of data. If one sample is provided, it should perform a one-sample Z-test. If two samples are provided, it should perform a two-sample Z-test. The samples should contain more than 30 unique values each; otherwise, the user should be advised to use a T-test.

2. `/ttest-equalvariance`: Perform a T-test assuming equal variance on two samples of data.

3. `/ttest-unequalvariance`: Perform a T-test assuming unequal variance on two samples of data.

4. `/normaltest`: Perform a normality test on the provided data samples.

5. `/outliertest`: Identify outliers in the provided data samples.

6. `/histogram`: Generate a histogram for the provided data samples.

7. `/zvalue`: Calculate the Z-scores for the provided data samples.

8. `/max`: Find the maximum value in the provided data samples.

9. `/min`: Find the minimum value in the provided data samples.

10. `/range`: Calculate the range (max - min) of the provided data samples.

11. `/kurtosis`: Calculate the kurtosis of the provided data samples.

12. `/skew`: Calculate the skewness of the provided data samples.

13. `/variance`: Calculate the variance of the provided data samples.

14. `/std`: Calculate the standard deviation of the provided data samples.

15. `/mean`: Calculate the mean of the provided data samples.

Each endpoint should accept JSON data via POST requests and return the results in JSON format. The application should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

The given code snippet already provides the implementation of the Flask application with the required endpoints. To test the correctness of the solution, we can create a series of test cases that simulate API calls to each endpoint with appropriate data samples and verify the responses.

Here is an example of how to test the `/mean` endpoint:

```python

# Assuming the Flask app is running on localhost and port 5000
base_url = 'http://localhost:5000'

# Test data for the `/mean` endpoint
test_data_mean = {

    ""Sample 2"": [35.5, 45.6, 60, 70, 80, 90]
}

# Make a POST request to the `/mean` endpoint
response = requests.post(f""{base_url}/mean"", json=test_data_mean)

# Check if the response is successful
assert response.status_code == 200

# Parse the response JSON
response_data = response.json()

# Verify the correctness of the mean calculation
expected_mean_sample_1 = sum(test_data_mean[""Sample 1""]) / len(test_data_mean[""Sample 1""])
expected_mean_sample_2 = sum(test_data_mean[""Sample 2""]) / len(test_data_mean[""Sample 2""])

assert abs(response_data[""Sample 1""] - expected_mean_sample_1) < 1e-6
assert abs(response_data[""Sample 2""] - expected_mean_sample_2) < 1e-6

print(""Mean endpoint test passed."")
```

To fully test the application, similar test cases should be created for each endpoint, using appropriate test data and verifying the results against expected values. The test cases should also include scenarios where the input data is invalid or insufficient to ensure that the application responds with the correct error messages.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `largest_prime_factor(n)` that takes an integer `n` and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number.

Write a Python script that simulates a simple database migration system for a hypothetical web application. The application has a database table named `pages` which contains a column `url` that needs to be altered. Initially, the `url` column is non-nullable, but a new requirement has emerged to make this column nullable to accommodate pages that do not have a URL yet.

Your task is to create two functions, `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`, which simulate the database migration process. The `upgrade()` function should alter the `url` column to be nullable, and the `downgrade()` function should revert this change, making the `url` column non-nullable again.

1. Use the DHT sensor (blue-colored, type 0) connected to port 7 on the GrovePi+ board to measure temperature (in Celsius) and humidity (in percentage).
2. Use the sound sensor connected to port 2 on the GrovePi+ board to measure the sound level.
3. Display the temperature, humidity, and sound level readings on the RGB LCD with a green backlight. The display should be formatted as follows:
   ```
   Temp:XX.XC Hum:XX.X%
   Sound:XXXX
   ```
   where `XX.X` represents the temperature and humidity values, and `XXXX` represents the sound level.
4. Log the temperature, humidity, sound level, and the current timestamp into a MariaDB database table named `Temp_Hum_Sound`. The table should have the following columns: `temperature`, `humidity`, `sound`, and `time`.
5. The program should handle exceptions gracefully and attempt to reconnect to the database if a connection is lost.
6. The program should run indefinitely, updating the LCD and logging to the database every 5 seconds until interrupted by the user (e.g., via a KeyboardInterrupt).

**Test Cases**:

Since the solution involves hardware interaction and a database, traditional unit tests are not applicable. However, you can verify the solution by running the program and observing the following:

1. The LCD should display the temperature, humidity, and sound level readings in the specified format.
2. The MariaDB database should have a new entry in the `Temp_Hum_Sound` table every 5 seconds with the corresponding sensor readings and timestamp.
3. The program should continue to run indefinitely until a KeyboardInterrupt is issued.
4. The program should handle sensor errors and database connection issues gracefully without crashing.",Python,McEval-Instruct

You want to find the number of ways to tile the entire board using these pieces. You may rotate the trominos, but you must not leave any square uncovered and you must not cover any square more than once.

In the provided solution, the `num_tilings` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to tile the board. The state `dp[i][0]` represents the number of ways to completely cover a 2 x i board, `dp[i][1]` represents the number of ways to cover a 2 x i board with the top right square missing, and `dp[i][2]` represents the number of ways to cover a 2 x i board with the bottom right square missing.

Design a Python program using SQLAlchemy ORM that models a simple banking system. The system should consist of three main models: `AccountData`, `FileInfo`, and `BankAccount`. 

`AccountData` should represent the financial data of an account, with fields for `id` (primary key), `active` (numeric value representing active funds), and `passive` (numeric value representing passive funds).

`FileInfo` should represent information about a file containing bank data, with fields for `id` (primary key), `file_name` (name of the file), `date_created` (the creation date of the file), `bank_name` (name of the bank), and `pub_date` (the publication date of the file). There should be a unique constraint on the combination of `bank_name` and `pub_date`.

`BankAccount` should represent a bank account, with fields for `id` (primary key), `account_id` (an identifier for the account), `file_info_id` (a foreign key to the `FileInfo` model), `opening_balance_id` (a foreign key to the `AccountData` model representing the opening balance), and `turnover_id` (a foreign key to the `AccountData` model representing the turnover). The `BankAccount` model should also establish relationships with `AccountData` for both `opening_balance` and `turnover`.

Write the SQLAlchemy ORM code to define these models, ensuring that you include the necessary imports, relationships, and constraints. Then, provide test cases to demonstrate the creation of instances for each model and the establishment of relationships between them.

Create a simple web application that allows users to vote on a question with three options: ""yes"", ""no"", or ""maybe"". The application should use Flask for the backend and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The votes are stored in a dictionary and updated in real-time as users submit their votes. The application should also serve an HTML page that displays the current vote totals and updates them as new votes are received.

The application should have the following features:
1. A Flask route that serves an HTML page with the current vote totals.
2. A Socket.IO event handler that listens for ""submit vote"" events, updates the vote totals, and emits the updated totals to all connected clients.
3. The HTML page should include a simple form that allows users to select one of the three voting options and submit their vote.

**Test Cases**:

Since this is a web application, the test cases would involve interacting with the web interface and the real-time Socket.IO events. However, for the purpose of this example, we will not provide interactive test cases but rather describe the expected behavior:

1. When a user navigates to the root URL (""/""), they should be served an HTML page with the current vote totals.
2. When a user submits a vote using the form on the HTML page, the vote should be processed by the `vote` function, the `votes` dictionary should be updated, and all connected clients should receive the updated vote totals in real-time.
3. If a user submits an invalid vote selection (not ""yes"", ""no"", or ""maybe""), the `vote` function should emit an error message to that user only.

Please note that to fully test this application, you would need to create an `index.html` file with the appropriate JavaScript to handle the form submission and Socket.IO communication, as well as set up a testing environment with multiple clients to observe the real-time updates.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Python script that simulates a simplified version of the Django admin site registration process for models. Your script should define two classes, `News` and `Author`, and a class `AdminSite` that can register these models. The `AdminSite` class should have a method `register` that takes a model class and adds it to an internal registry. The registry should be a dictionary where the keys are the model class names and the values are the model classes themselves.

Additionally, implement a method `get_registered_models` that returns a list of registered model names. Ensure that if a model is already registered, it should not be registered again, and an appropriate message should be printed.

    # Get the list of registered models
    registered_models = admin_site.get_registered_models()

```

This script should output:

```
Model 'News' registered successfully.
Model 'Author' registered successfully.
Model 'News' is already registered.
Registered Models: ['News', 'Author']
```

The script defines two classes, `News` and `Author`, and a class `AdminSite` that mimics the Django admin site's model registration mechanism. The `AdminSite` class has a method `register` to add models to its registry and a method `get_registered_models` to retrieve the names of registered models. The test cases demonstrate the registration process and the prevention of duplicate registrations.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class named `Date` that represents a simple calendar date. The class should have the following functionalities:

1. Initialize a `Date` object with day, month, and year.
2. Display the date in the format `dd-mm-yyyy`.
3. Setters for day, month, and year with basic validation:
    - `set_day` should accept a day between 1 and 31.
    - `set_month` should accept a month between 1 and 12.
    - `set_year` should accept a positive year.
4. An additional method `add_days` that adds a given number of days to the date, taking into account leap years and the number of days in each month.

The class should handle invalid date settings by raising a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

Write a Python function `create_urlpatterns` that generates a list of Django URL patterns for a given list of view functions. The function should take two arguments: a list of view function names (as strings) and a corresponding list of URL paths (also as strings). Each view function name should be associated with a URL path at the same index in their respective lists.

The function should return a list of `path` objects, similar to the `urlpatterns` list in the given code snippet. Assume that the `path` function is imported from `django.urls` and that the view functions are imported from a module named `views`.

Additionally, each URL pattern should be named using the view function name prefixed with 'url_'. For example, if the view function name is 'register', the URL name should be 'url_register'.

Here is the function signature:

```python

Write a function `compress_string` that takes a list of characters and compresses it by using the run-length encoding algorithm. This algorithm replaces sequences of the same character with that character followed by the number of times it appears consecutively. The function should modify the input list in place and return the new length of the list after compression.

For example, given the list `['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c']`, the function should modify the list to `['a', '2', 'b', '2', 'c', '3']` and return `6`.

The function should handle the case where the number of consecutive characters is `1` by not adding a count after the character.

The input list will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters.

Design a Python function `simulate_isentropic_turbine_performance` that models the performance of an isentropic turbine using the IDAES Integrated Platform Framework. The function should take the following inputs:

- `flow_rate`: The inlet flow rate of the working fluid in moles per second (default value: 1000 mol/s).
- `inlet_temperature`: The inlet temperature of the working fluid in Kelvin (default value: 500 K).
- `inlet_pressure`: The inlet pressure of the working fluid in Pascals (default value: 1e6 Pa).
- `pressure_ratio`: The ratio of outlet pressure to inlet pressure (default value: 0.7).
- `isentropic_efficiency`: The isentropic efficiency of the turbine (default value: 0.9).

The function should create and initialize a Pyomo model of an isentropic turbine, simulate its performance, and return the following outputs:

- `outlet_temperature`: The outlet temperature of the working fluid in Kelvin.
- `outlet_pressure`: The outlet pressure of the working fluid in Pascals.
- `power_output`: The power output of the turbine in Watts.

The function should use the IAPWS-95 formulation for water and steam properties provided by the IDAES framework.

2. Locate and click on a specific product using its XPath.
3. Wait for the product page to load completely.
4. Locate and click on the ""Add to Cart"" button using its XPath.
5. Verify that the product has been successfully added to the cart by checking for a specific element that confirms the addition.

The questions and their correct answers are provided in a separate data source named `quiz_data`, which is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a 'question' and its 'correct_answer'.

The game should have the following features:
- Display each question to the user and prompt them for an answer.
- Check the user's answer against the correct answer.
- Provide feedback to the user indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
- Display the correct answer if the user's answer was incorrect.
- Keep track of the number of correct answers and display the user's score after each question.
- Continue to the next question until there are no more questions.
- Display the user's final score at the end of the quiz.

In a 2D game environment, we have entities that can move around within a certain boundary. The `Entity` class is a subclass of `pyglet.sprite.Sprite` and represents any object in the game that has a position. The `Character` class is a subclass of `Entity` and represents a character in the game that can move to a specific coordinate.

Your task is to extend the given code snippet to include the following functionalities:

1. Implement the `move` method in the `Character` class that updates the character's position by a given delta for x and y coordinates. The character should not move outside the specified width and height boundaries of the game environment.

2. Implement the `is_within_bounds` method in the `Character` class that checks if the character is within the game boundaries after a potential move.

3. Write a `GameEnvironment` class that initializes with a width and height and can add characters to the environment. It should have a method `update` that moves all characters in the environment by their specified deltas if they remain within bounds.

4. Ensure that the `Character` class correctly initializes the sprite using the `__init__` method from the `Entity` class.

5. Provide test cases to verify that characters can move within the game environment and are correctly bounded by the environment's limits.

Create a Python program using the Pygame library to implement a classic Snake game with a twist. The game should have the following features:

1. A 20x20 grid where the snake moves.
2. The snake starts at the center of the grid and grows by one segment each time it eats an apple.
3. Apples appear randomly on the grid, one at a time, and only in empty spaces.
4. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. It moves one grid space at a time.
5. If the snake hits the wall, it should teleport to the opposite side of the grid, continuing in the same direction.
6. The game ends if the snake runs into itself.
7. The player's score should be displayed on a HUD at the top of the screen and should increase by one each time the snake eats an apple.
8. The game should be controllable using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
9. The game should run at a consistent speed, making the snake move smoothly.

You are tasked with writing a Python program that processes a CSV file containing information about individuals who have applied for a training program. The CSV file has a header row with column names, and each subsequent row contains data for a single applicant. The program should categorize applicants into two groups based on their self-reported skill level: 'beginner' or 'intermediate'. The skill level is one of the columns in the CSV file.

Your program should define two functions: `sort_by_level` and `write_to_file`.

The `sort_by_level` function should:
- Accept a filename (string) as its argument.
- Read the CSV file and parse its contents.
- Categorize applicants into two lists: `beginners` and `intermediates`, based on the skill level column.
- Handle any misspellings of the 'intermediate' level (e.g., 'intermidiate') by including them in the intermediates list.
- Print a warning for any unrecognized skill levels and skip improperly formatted lines.
- Return the two lists of applicants, where each applicant is represented as a string in the format ""first_name,last_name,email\n"".

The `write_to_file` function should:
- Accept a filename (string) and a list of data (list of strings) as its arguments.
- Write the list of data to the specified file, with each element of the list as a separate line.
- Print a success message indicating the number of lines written to the file.

Your program should also include test cases that verify the correctness of the solution using example data.

# Write first name, last name, and email to individual files

Create a Python application using Tkinter that allows users to set up events and associate them with a list of file paths. The application should have a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following features:

1. A title ""A.N.T.O.N"" displayed at the top of the window.
2. A section to input the name of the event.
3. A button to add a new file path to the current event.
4. A button to save the event with its associated file paths to a configuration file named ""event.txt"".
5. A button to add a new event, which should open a new window to input additional events.
6. The application should use a background image for the GUI.
7. The application should not be resizable.

The configuration file ""event.txt"" should store the events and their associated file paths in a dictionary format. When the user saves an event, the application should write the event name and its file paths to the ""event.txt"" file and then restart the application.

You are tasked with creating a Django web application for a blogging platform. The application should allow users to view a list of blog posts, view individual posts, create new posts, update existing posts, and delete their own posts. The application should also provide a user-specific view that displays all posts by a particular user. User authentication is required for creating, updating, and deleting posts.

Implement the necessary Django class-based views to handle these functionalities. Your implementation should include the following:

1. A `PostListView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin` and `ListView` to display all posts in descending order by the date they were posted. It should paginate the posts, showing 5 posts per page.

2. A `UserPostListView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin` and `ListView` to display posts by a specific user, identified by their username in the URL. It should also paginate the posts, showing 5 posts per page.

3. A `PostDetailView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin` and `DetailView` to display the details of a single post.

4. A `PostCreateView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin` and `CreateView` to handle the creation of new posts. The view should ensure that the author of the post is set to the currently logged-in user.

5. A `PostUpdateView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, and `UpdateView` to handle the updating of existing posts. The view should only allow the author of the post to update it.

6. A `PostDeleteView` that inherits from `LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, and `DeleteView` to handle the deletion of posts. The view should only allow the author of the post to delete it and should redirect to the home page upon successful deletion.

7. An `about` function-based view that renders an ""About"" page for the blog.

Design a Python program that simulates a simple chat server using sockets. The server should be able to listen to incoming messages from multiple clients and print them to the console. Each client is represented by a unique process ID, and the server configuration, including the IP and port for each client, is loaded from a JSON file named `process_config.json`.

The JSON configuration file should have the following structure:
```json
{
    ""processes"": {
        ""1"": [""127.0.0.1"", 8001],
        ""2"": [""127.0.0.1"", 8002],
        ""3"": [""127.0.0.1"", 8003]
    }
}
```

Each key in the ""processes"" dictionary is a unique process ID, and the value is a list containing the IP address and port number for that process.

The program should include a `CommThread` class that extends the `Thread` class from the `threading` module. This class should override the `run` method to set up a TCP server socket that listens for incoming messages on the IP and port specified in the configuration file for the given process ID. When a message is received, it should be printed to the console in the format ""message received: [message]"".

Write the complete program following the guidelines, including the necessary imports, the `CommThread` class, and the main execution logic that reads the configuration file and starts a communication thread for each process. Also, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

    # Join threads to wait for them to finish (optional, for demonstration purposes)
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
```

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to simulate client connections sending messages to the server. This can be done by creating a simple client script that connects to the server and sends a message. Here is an example of how you might test one of the communication threads:

```python
import socket

# Function to simulate a client sending a message
def send_message(proc_id, message):
    pIp, pPort = config[""processes""][proc_id]
    clientSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    clientSocket.connect((pIp, pPort))
    clientSocket.send(message.encode())
    clientSocket.close()

# Test case: Send a message to process ID '1'
send_message(""1"", ""Hello from client to process 1"")
```

Please note that the test case provided above should be run in a separate Python script or interactive session while the server is running. The server will print the received message to the console when it is executed.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `generate_url_statistics_report` that processes a dataset of web URLs and their associated metrics to produce a LaTeX-formatted report. The dataset is provided in the ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) format and contains information about URLs, their target platforms, and counts of internal and external elements.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Load the ARFF dataset and convert it into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Read a list of Alexa URLs from a text file, where each line contains a single URL.
3. Process the DataFrame to calculate the sum of internal and external elements for each URL grouped by the target platform, excluding any entries where the target platform is 'null'.
4. Map each URL in the DataFrame to either an Alexa URL or a constructed student URL based on a specific pattern.
5. Sort the Alexa URLs and student URLs separately in ascending order based on the URL string.
6. Generate two LaTeX-formatted tables, one for Alexa URLs and one for student URLs, with columns for URL, total elements, and sums of internal and external elements for each target platform.
7. Return the LaTeX-formatted tables as strings.

The function signature is as follows:

You are tasked with creating a Django administration command that registers models and their corresponding admin classes to the Django admin site. The models are `Factory`, `Image`, and `ReportRecord`, along with their recycled counterparts `RecycledFactory`, `RecycledImage`, and `RecycledReportRecord`. Each model has a corresponding admin class with the same name followed by 'Admin'.

Write a Python function `register_models_to_admin` that takes no arguments and registers each model with its respective admin class to the Django admin site. The function should use the `admin.site.register` method to perform the registration.

Additionally, provide test cases that verify the registration of the models. You can mock the `admin.site.register` method to ensure that it is called with the correct arguments.

Write a Python program that compares the output of two different command-line applications and prints the differences. Assume that you have two applications, one written in Rust and the other in .NET, both of which are supposed to produce the same output given the same input. Your task is to automate the process of running both applications and comparing their outputs to ensure they are consistent.

The Rust application can be run using the Cargo package manager with the command `cargo run` in the directory `regex_rust`, and the .NET application can be run using the .NET CLI with the command `dotnet run` in the directory `regex_dotnet`.

Your program should:
- Execute both applications and capture their standard output.
- Check the return code of each application to ensure it ran successfully.
- If both applications run successfully, compare their outputs line by line and print the differences.
- If there are differences, print each line with a prefix indicating whether the line is unique to the Rust output (`-`), unique to the .NET output (`+`), or present in both but changed (`?`).
- If either application fails to run, print an error message along with the standard error output from the failed application.
- Ensure that all necessary packages are imported at the beginning of the code snippet.

Write a Python function `sync_salesforce_user` that synchronizes a user's information from Salesforce to a Django application's user model. The function should take an `OAuth` object as input, which contains the Salesforce user's ID, email, and a generated password. The function should check if a user with the given Salesforce ID already exists in the Django application's user model. If the user exists, it should update the user's email. If the user does not exist, it should create a new user with the Salesforce ID as the username, the provided email, and password.

The Django user model should be retrieved using the `get_user_model` function from `django.contrib.auth`. Assume that the user model has `username`, `email`, and `password` fields.

Wordle Assistant

Wordle is a popular word game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Each guess provides feedback in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

Your task is to create a Wordle Assistant that helps players by narrowing down the list of possible words based on the feedback from their guesses. The assistant should consider the following:

- Green letters (`greenLetters`) are letters that are in the word and in the correct position.
- Yellow letters (`yellowLetters`) are letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.
- Bad letters (`badLetters`) are letters that are not in the word at all.

The assistant should filter a list of five-letter words from two files: `common5.txt` for common words and `word-list-5.txt` for a comprehensive list of five-letter words. It should then display a list of possible words, prioritizing common words.

Implement the Wordle Assistant with the following functions:

- `getCommon5()`: Reads the `common5.txt` file and returns a list of common five-letter words.
- `makePositionPattern()`: Creates a regex pattern for green letters based on their positions.
- `makeNotPositionPattern()`: Creates a regex pattern for yellow letters that must not be in specific positions.
- `makeExcludePattern()`: Creates a regex pattern to exclude bad letters.
- `evaluateMatchingRules(word)`: Evaluates if a given word matches the green, yellow, and bad letter patterns.
- `printWords(commonWords, uncommonWords)`: Prints the filtered list of words, prioritizing common words.
- `runProcess()`: Processes the word lists and applies the filtering rules.
- `interview()`: Interactively collects the player's guess and the feedback (green and yellow letters), updating the assistant's knowledge.
- `main()`: Entry point for the assistant, which clears the screen and starts the interview process.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the solution's correctness, you would need to have the `common5.txt` and `word-list-5.txt` files with a list of five-letter words. Since we cannot provide these files here, you would need to create them yourself or mock their contents for testing purposes.

Here's an example of how you might test the `evaluateMatchingRules` function with a mock setup:

```python
# Mock setup
badLetters = ['a', 'e']
goodLetters = ['r', 't']
greenLetters = ['r']
yellowLetters = ['t']
greenPosition = {0: 'r'}
yellowPosition = {2: 't'}

# Test cases
assert evaluateMatchingRules('right') == True
assert evaluateMatchingRules('trace') == False
assert evaluateMatchingRules('trend') == True
assert evaluateMatchingRules('react') == False

print(""All tests passed!"")
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `interview` function is omitted for brevity, as it involves interactive input and updating the assistant's knowledge based on the player's feedback.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program that integrates with a configuration management system (e.g., Puppet) to verify the integrity of installed packages on a system. The program should use a plugin system to modify the verification checks with checksums provided by Puppet, ensuring that the verification process does not produce false positives when the system state managed by Puppet differs from the expected state of a package manager like Yum.

The program should:
- Load a YAML file that contains the state of files as managed by Puppet, including their checksums.
- Provide a hook to verify the integrity of each package by comparing the actual file checksums with those specified by Puppet.
- Allow configuration of the path to the Puppet state file through a plugin configuration hook.

The Puppet state file is expected to be in YAML format and contain entries like:
```yaml
File[/path/to/file]:
  checksums:
    md5: ""{md5}a4b2c3d4e5f67890""
```

The program should define a plugin system with at least two hooks:
- `verify_package_hook`: This hook should be called for each package that needs verification. It should update the package's verification data with the checksum from Puppet if available.
- `config_hook`: This hook should be used to configure the path to the Puppet state file.

You are tasked with writing a program that reads a sequence of digits from a file named ""input.txt"", where each digit represents a pixel's color in an image. The image is encoded in layers, and each layer is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall. The digits in the file are contiguous, with no delimiters, and represent the image in layers from top to bottom.

The color of each pixel is determined by the first layer in which it is not transparent. The colors are encoded as follows:
- 0 represents a black pixel.
- 1 represents a white pixel.
- 2 represents a transparent pixel.

Your program should process the input file and render the final image by determining the color of each pixel. The output should be printed to the console, with each row of the image on a new line. Use the character ""#"" to represent white pixels and ""-"" to represent black pixels.

Write a function `render_image` that takes the filename as an argument and prints the rendered image to the console.

```
-#

Create a Python program using the Tkinter library that simulates a simple drawing application. The application should allow users to draw freehand paths on a canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse. The user should be able to control the following aspects of the drawing:

1. The color of the path (options: ""Black"", ""Red"", ""Blue"", ""Green"").
2. The speed of the drawing (options: ""Speed X 1"", ""Speed X 2"", ""Speed X 3""), which affects the density of points in the path.
3. The ability to start and stop the drawing process.

The program should have a GUI with the following elements:

- A canvas area where the user can draw.
- A label displaying the current path color.
- A dropdown menu to select the path color.
- A label displaying the current drawing speed.
- A dropdown menu to select the drawing speed.
- A button to start the drawing process.
- A button to stop the drawing process and clear the canvas.

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, write a function to compare if the two strings are equal when typed into empty text editors. Here, `#` means a backspace character.

The function should simulate the process of typing out the strings character by character, including the backspace. The backspace character `#` means the previous non-backspace character is erased. If the backspace is typed when there is no character to erase, it has no effect.

Implement the class `Solution` with the following method:

- `backspace_compare(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool`: A method that takes two strings and returns `True` if they are equal after applying the backspace operation, and `False` otherwise.

**Example**:

```python
S = ""ab##""
T = ""c#d#""

print(sol.backspace_compare(S, T))  # Output: True

S = ""a##c""
T = ""#a#c""
print(sol.backspace_compare(S, T))  # Output: True

S = ""a#c""
T = ""b""

Design a Python program that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for generating styled text outputs, including titles, boxed text, and evaluation summaries. The program should use the `click` library to handle CLI interactions and the provided code snippet as a starting point for implementing the text styling functions.

The program should include the following features:

1. A `title` command that takes a string and prints it as a title with an underline. It should have options to specify the underline character and whether to transform the text to title case.

2. A `box` command that takes a string and prints it inside a box made of a specified border character.

3. An `evaluation` command that simulates the output of an evaluation process, including the success or failure of various commands. It should print a detailed evaluation if the verbosity is set to verbose, or a summary otherwise.

4. A `summary` command that takes an evaluation object and prints a summary of the evaluation, indicating whether it was successful or which commands failed.

The program should handle the styling of text using the provided functions and should be able to unstyle text where necessary using `click.unstyle`.

In a small country, there is a number of immigration counters at the airport. Each counter takes a certain amount of time to process a single person. Given the number of people waiting in the immigration queue and the time each counter takes to process one person, your task is to find the minimum total time required to process all the people.

Write a function `minimum_processing_time` that takes two arguments: `n`, the number of people in the queue, and `times`, a list of integers where each integer represents the time each counter takes to process one person. The function should return the minimum total time required to process all `n` people.

Assume that:
- There are at least 1 and at most 100,000 people in the queue.

Design a quantum circuit that performs a series of operations to prepare for quantum counting. The circuit should consist of five layers, each performing a specific set of operations on a set of qubits. The operations should include Hadamard gates, a controlled Grover iteration loop, a swap operation loop, quantum Fourier transform (QFT) elements, and measurements. The circuit should be designed to work with two quantum registers and one classical register, each containing four qubits.

The circuit should be constructed as follows:

- **Layer L1**: Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits in both quantum registers.
- **Layer L2**: Perform a controlled Grover iteration loop on the second quantum register, with the first quantum register acting as control qubits. The Grover iteration should be applied a number of times equal to the power of 2 corresponding to the state of the control qubits.
- **Layer L3**: Apply a loop of swap operations on the first quantum register, where each pair of qubits is swapped in sequence.
- **Layer L4**: Implement QFT elements on the first quantum register without any control qubits.
- **Layer L5**: Measure all qubits in the first quantum register and store the results in the classical register.

Assume that the `Elementary_Gates`, `Composite_Gates`, `Loop_Operations`, and `Measurements` modules provide the necessary classes and methods to create the gates and loops required for the circuit. The `ElementaryGate`, `CompositeGate`, `LoopOperation`, and `MeasurementGate` classes have methods that return the corresponding gate objects to be appended to the quantum circuit.

Write a function `numRollsToTarget` that calculates the number of distinct ways you can roll a set of dice to reach a specific target sum. The function will be part of a class `Solution` and will use memoization to optimize the computation for multiple calls with the same parameters.

The function should take three parameters:
- `d` (int): The number of dice to roll.
- `f` (int): The number of faces on each die (all dice are the same and are numbered from 1 to `f`).
- `target` (int): The target sum to achieve with the dice rolls.

The function should return the number of distinct ways to roll the `d` dice to sum up to the `target`. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

For example, if you have `d = 2` dice, each with `f = 6` faces, and the target sum is `7`, there are six ways to roll the dice to get a sum of 7: `(1, 6)`, `(2, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 3)`, `(5, 2)`, and `(6, 1)`.

You are given a list of characters where each character represents a type of fruit. You have two baskets, and your goal is to collect the maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can hold only one type of fruit.

You will start picking fruit from any tree and continue to do so without skipping any trees. The picking stops when you have to pick from a third type of fruit, as you can only hold two types of fruits in your baskets.

Write a function `max_fruits_in_baskets(fruits)` that takes a list of characters as input, where each character represents a fruit type, and returns the maximum number of fruits that can be collected in both baskets under the given conditions.

**Example**:

```python
Input: fruits = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C'].

Input: fruits = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C'].

                del fruit_count[fruits[window_start]]

```

In the solution, we use a sliding window approach to keep track of the fruits collected in the baskets. We use a dictionary `fruit_count` to count the number of each type of fruit within the current window. If at any point we have more than two types of fruits, we shrink the window from the start until we are back to two types. We keep track of the maximum number of fruits collected in `max_fruits` and return it at the end.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Django application that manages series and user reviews. Each series can have multiple reviews, but a user can only leave one review per series. Reviews consist of a rating from 1 to 5. The application should automatically calculate and update the average rating of a series whenever a new review is added or an existing review is updated.

Implement the `Review` model with the following requirements:

1. The `Review` model should have a `rating` field that accepts integers from 1 to 5.
2. The `Review` model should have a `serie` field that creates a foreign key relationship with a `Serie` model (not provided in the snippet).
3. The `Review` model should have a `user` field that creates a foreign key relationship with a `User` model (not provided in the snippet).
4. Ensure that a user can only leave one review per series by setting the appropriate constraints.
5. Override the `save` method to calculate and update the average rating of the series associated with the review.

Write a Python script that defines the `Review` model according to the above specifications. Also, provide test cases to verify that the average rating is correctly calculated and updated when a review is saved.

Write a Python program to control a servo motor's position using a simple command-line interface. The servo motor can be positioned to the left, right, or center based on user input. The program should use the Adafruit_BBIO library to interface with the servo motor on a BeagleBone Black board.

The servo motor should have three positions:
- Left: 2ms pulse (10% duty cycle)
- Right: 1ms pulse (5% duty cycle)
- Center: 1.5ms pulse (7.5% duty cycle)

The program should prompt the user to enter a command ('left', 'right', 'center', or 'exit') and move the servo to the corresponding position. If the user enters 'exit', the program should terminate and clean up the hardware resources.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the solution, you would need to run the program on a BeagleBone Black board with a servo motor connected to the specified pin (e.g., P1_36). Since this is hardware-dependent, the test cases would be manual:

1. Run the program and enter `left`. The servo should move to the left position.
2. Enter `right`. The servo should move to the right position.
3. Enter `center`. The servo should move to the center position.
4. Enter `exit`. The program should terminate and the servo should stop receiving signals.
5. Try entering an invalid command. The program should prompt for a valid command.

Please note that the actual movement of the servo motor needs to be observed physically as it cannot be verified through a traditional automated testing framework.",Python,McEval-Instruct

The program should define a function `calculate_cylinder_properties` that takes two arguments, `height` and `radius`, and returns a tuple containing the volume and curved surface area of the cylinder.

The volume `V` of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \pi \times radius^2 \times height \]

The curved surface area `A` of a cylinder (excluding the top and bottom) can be calculated using the formula:

In a cave system represented as an undirected graph, each cave is connected by a tunnel to one or more other caves. The caves are either big or small. Big caves are written in uppercase (like `A`, `B`, etc.), and small caves are written in lowercase (like `start`, `end`, `an`, etc.). The goal is to find the number of distinct paths that start at the cave named `start`, end at the cave named `end`, and visit small caves at most once. However, one small cave (not `start` or `end`) can be visited twice, but no other small cave can be visited more than once.

Write a function `count_paths` that takes a filename as an argument. The file contains the cave connections, one per line, in the format `CaveA-CaveB`. The function should read the file, build the graph of caves, and return the total number of distinct paths that meet the criteria described above.

In the provided solution, the `count_paths` function reads the cave connections from a file and uses a recursive helper function `visit` to explore all possible paths through the cave system. The `visit` function keeps track of visited small caves and allows one small cave to be visited twice. The test cases assume the existence of two files with specified contents and provide the expected number of paths for each file.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python class named `ArrayMultiplier` that contains a method `multiply_arrays` which takes two lists of integers, `listA` and `listB`, and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from `listA` and `listB`. The method should raise a `ValueError` if the input lists are not of the same length.

The class should also include a static method `performance_comparison` that takes two lists of integers and compares the performance of the `multiply_arrays` method with a naive implementation using loops. The comparison should be presented in the form of a table and a plot, showing the time taken by each implementation to multiply the arrays.

The table should have the following columns: 'Method', 'Execution Time'. The plot should display the execution time of each method on the y-axis and the method name on the x-axis.

Design a Python module named `qt_compat` that provides a compatibility layer for PyQt/PySide applications to work with both Qt5 and Qt6. The module should expose the `QApplication`, `QAction`, and `QShortcut` classes, ensuring that they are accessible with the same API regardless of the underlying Qt version.

The module should:
- Import the necessary Qt modules dynamically based on the version of Qt being used.
- Define a `QApplication` class that has an `exec` method, which should be an alias to `exec_` if the Qt version is 5.
- Define `QAction` and `QShortcut` classes from the appropriate Qt module if the Qt version is 6.
- Provide a way to determine the API name (Qt5 or Qt6) being used.

Write the `qt_compat` module following the guidelines and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python class `EnvironmentSensor` that simulates an environment sensor similar to the Sense HAT used on the Raspberry Pi. The class should be able to read temperature, humidity, pressure, and provide data from an accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass. Each sensor reading should be simulated with a random value within a reasonable range for testing purposes.

Write a test suite using `unittest` to verify that the `EnvironmentSensor` class is functioning correctly. The test suite should check that each sensor method returns a value and that the value is within the expected range. Assume that the temperature ranges from -40 to 50 degrees Celsius, humidity from 0 to 100%, pressure from 300 to 1100 hPa, and the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass return a tuple of three floats representing the x, y, and z axis values.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple persistence layer for tracking containers that have not been delivered yet.

Design a vehicle dealership contract system that calculates the total and monthly values of buying and leasing contracts for different types of vehicles (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) and different types of customers (Customer, Employee). The system should account for the following:

1. The base price of the vehicle, which is adjusted based on the vehicle's mileage and age.
2. A tax rate of 7% is applied to the total value of the buy contract.
3. Employees receive a 10% discount on the total value of the buy contract before taxes.
4. The lease contract's total value is calculated based on the length of the lease and a monthly lease multiplier (1.2 for cars, 1.7 for trucks, and 1.1 for motorcycles).
5. The monthly value of the contract is the total value divided by the number of payments (for buy contracts) or the length of the lease (for lease contracts).

Implement the classes `BuyContract` and `LeaseContract` with methods `total_value` and `monthly_value` to calculate the respective values. Use the provided test cases to verify the correctness of your implementation.

Create a Python program that analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington—to uncover usage patterns and user demographics. The program should allow users to filter the data by city, month (January to June), and day of the week. It should calculate and display the following statistics:

1. The most frequent times of travel, including the most common month, day of the week, and start hour.
2. The most popular stations and trips, including the most commonly used start station, end station, and the most frequent combination of start and end stations.
3. Trip duration statistics, including the total travel time and the average travel time.
4. User statistics, including counts of user types, gender distribution, and the earliest, most recent, and most common years of birth (where available).

The program should also provide an option to display raw data in increments of five rows upon user request. The user should be able to continue viewing more data in increments of five rows until they decide to stop. Finally, the program should allow the user to restart the analysis after displaying the statistics.

Write a function `twoSum` that takes an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, and returns the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example**:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Constraints**:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`

Design a simple space shooter game component where a player can shoot bullets upwards to hit targets. The player is located at the bottom of the screen and can only move along the x-axis. The bullet is represented by a yellow triangle that moves upwards when fired. The bullet should be hidden and inactive until the player fires it. Once fired, the bullet should move upwards at a constant speed. If the bullet reaches the top of the screen without hitting a target, it should disappear and become inactive again.

Write a Python class `Bullet` that extends the `Turtle` class from the `turtle` module to represent the bullet in the game. The class should have the following methods:

- `__init__(self)`: Constructor to initialize the bullet with the specified shape, color, size, and initial state.
- `move_bullet(self)`: Method to move the bullet upwards. If the bullet goes beyond a certain y-coordinate (e.g., 220), it should be hidden and its state set to inactive.
- `shoot_bullet(self, player)`: Method to fire the bullet. It should set the bullet's state to active, position it at the player's current x-coordinate, and show the bullet on the screen.

Additionally, write a simple test case to demonstrate the creation of a `Bullet` instance, firing it, and moving it.

Design a gRPC-based calendar service that allows clients to schedule reminders for specific dates and times. The service should be able to receive reminder data, validate it, and schedule an email to be sent at the specified reminder time. The service should also handle errors gracefully and report them to an error handling service.

The reminder data should include:
- A unique identifier for the reminder (id)
- The email address to which the reminder should be sent (email)
- The note or message of the reminder (note)
- The date and time when the reminder should be sent (date_remind)
- The date and time when the note was created (date_note)

The service should have the following functionalities:
- Receive and validate incoming reminder data.
- Schedule the reminder and send an email at the specified time.
- Handle any errors during email sending and report them to an error handling service.

Implement the `CalendarServicer` class with a `RecieveData` method that processes incoming reminder requests. The method should validate the data and use a producer function to schedule the reminder. If the data is invalid, it should return a status indicating failure.

Additionally, implement a `serve` function that starts the gRPC server and continuously checks for scheduled reminders to send emails. If an email fails to send, it should report the error using an error handling service.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the solution's correctness, you would need to set up a gRPC client to send requests to the server and check the responses. Additionally, you would need to mock the `func_producer`, `func_consumer`, and `send_email` functions to simulate their behavior and validate that the server behaves as expected.

Since the actual implementation of these functions and the gRPC client setup is not provided, we cannot write executable test cases here. However, in a real-world scenario, you would write unit tests for the `RecieveData` method and integration tests for the `serve` function to ensure that the server starts correctly and processes incoming requests as expected.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a fictional universe, there are multiple space stations each belonging to a different region of space. Each station has a unique name, a shorthand name derived from its official name, a unique station ID, and a region ID indicating the region of space it belongs to. The `Station` class is used to represent each space station and interact with a space data exploration client (SDE client) to retrieve station and region IDs.

Your task is to implement the `Station` class with the following specifications:

1. The `Station` class should have an `__init__` method that takes in an `sde_client` and a `station_name`. The `sde_client` is a mock object that simulates interaction with a database to retrieve station and region IDs. The `station_name` is a string representing the official name of the station.

2. The `find_station_id` method should simulate a call to the SDE client to retrieve the station ID based on the station's name. For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the SDE client's `Station.getStations` method returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a station, including its 'stationID'.

3. The `find_region_id` method should simulate a call to the SDE client to retrieve the region ID in a similar manner to `find_station_id`.

4. The `generate_shorthand` method should create a shorthand name for the station by taking the first word of the station's official name.

5. The class should also include getter methods for the station name, station ID, region ID, and station shorthand name.

For testing purposes, you should create a mock SDE client that can be used to instantiate the `Station` class and test its methods. The mock SDE client should have a `Station.getStations` method that takes a `stationName` parameter and returns a list with a single dictionary containing 'stationID' and 'regionID' for the given station name.

Design a Python program that interacts with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange API to monitor the Bitcoin (BTC/USD) market. The program should perform the following tasks:

1. Retrieve the current order book for the BTC/USD market with a specified depth.
2. Fetch the latest trade for BTC/USD and calculate the return percentage based on the previous price.
3. Keep track of the total bid and ask volumes in the order book to calculate the spread (difference between total bid volume and total ask volume).
4. Record the spread and the latest trade price in an Excel file named 'crypto.xlsx' with two columns: 'spread' and 'price'.
5. Continuously update the Excel file with new data until a maximum count of data points is reached or a stop condition is met.
6. Plot a real-time graph of the BTC/USD price using matplotlib, updating the graph with each new trade.

The program should be robust, handle any potential errors from the API, and ensure that the Excel file is properly saved and closed upon completion. The program should also include a mechanism to gracefully handle interruptions and resume where it left off.

Design a Python program that simulates a simple music album management system. The system should be able to add new albums to a collection, retrieve all albums, and search for albums based on specific criteria such as title, artist, year, or genre. The program should interact with a backend service, `AlbumService`, which handles the actual data storage and retrieval.

The `AlbumService` class should have the following methods:
- `add_record(self, title, artist, year, genre)`: Adds a new album to the collection.
- `get_all_albums(self)`: Retrieves all albums in the collection.
- `search_by_option(self, option, value)`: Searches for albums based on the given option (title, artist, year, or genre) and value.

The program should provide a text-based menu to the user with the following options:
1. Add a new album to the collection.
2. Get all albums in the collection.
3. Search for an album.
4. Quit the program.

The search functionality should prompt the user to choose the search criteria and then ask for the corresponding value to search for.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, we can simulate user input and check the output. However, since the program is interactive and requires user input, we would need to mock the input and output to fully automate testing. Below are some manual test cases that can be performed:

1. Add a new album:
   - Select option 1.
   - Enter the album title: ""Thriller"".
   - Enter the artist name: ""Michael Jackson"".
   - Enter the album production year: 1982.
   - Enter the genre: ""Pop"".
   - Verify that the album is added to the collection.

2. Get all albums:
   - Select option 2.
   - Verify that all added albums are displayed.

3. Search for an album by title:
   - Select option 3.
   - Choose option 1 to search by title.
   - Enter the title: ""Thriller"".
   - Verify that the album with the title ""Thriller"" is displayed.

4. Quit the program:
   - Select option 4.
   - Verify that the program terminates.

Please note that for a fully automated test suite, we would need to refactor the code to allow dependency injection of the `AlbumService` and use mocking frameworks to simulate user input and capture output.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a RESTful API using Flask that provides user authentication and token refresh functionality. The API should have two endpoints: `/login` for user authentication and `/auth/refresh` for refreshing JWT tokens. The user authentication should verify the user's email and password, create JWT access and refresh tokens, and return user details along with the tokens. The token refresh endpoint should require a valid refresh token and return a new access token.

The user data is stored in a database with the `User` model, which includes fields such as `email`, `password`, `name`, `id`, and `userType`. The password stored in the database is an MD5 hash of the actual password. The API should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages and status codes.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would typically write unit tests for the Flask application. However, since this is an interactive environment, we will describe the test cases that should be performed:

1. Test the `/login` endpoint with correct email and password. Expect a 200 status code and a JSON response with access and refresh tokens.
2. Test the `/login` endpoint with incorrect email or password. Expect an error response with the appropriate error message.
3. Test the `/auth/refresh` endpoint with a valid refresh token. Expect a 200 status code and a new access token in the response.
4. Test the `/auth/refresh` endpoint with an invalid or expired refresh token. Expect an error response indicating the token is invalid or expired.

In a real-world scenario, these tests would be automated using a testing framework such as `unittest` or `pytest` and would involve mocking the database queries and responses.",Python,McEval-Instruct

You are tasked with creating a report that identifies exceptions in stock product and industry data. The report should highlight unusual variations in the data that could indicate potential issues. The data is stored in a Spark environment and is updated daily. Your job is to write a Python class that extends `LeekSparkJob` to perform the following tasks:

1. Initialize with the necessary table configurations.
2. Retrieve the total number of records for a given date from two different tables: one for product data and one for industry data.
3. Compute daily exception rates for products and industries by joining the exception data with the total number of records and calculating the rate of exceptions.
4. The exception rates to be calculated are:
    - Product exception rate
    - Industry exception rate
    - Product and industry re-equal exception rate
    - Product positive-negative exception rate
    - Industry positive-negative exception rate
5. The final report should be saved to a specified table and should be partitioned by the `enddate`.

The class should include methods for initializing data, retrieving the total number of records, and performing the daily computation. The daily computation should persist intermediate results to disk for performance reasons and repartition the final DataFrame to optimize for parallel processing.

Write a function `find_kth_largest` that takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns the `k`th largest element in the list. The function should implement a sorting algorithm to sort the list in ascending order and then return the `k`th largest element, which is the element at the index `len(arr) - k` after sorting.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:
- The input list `arr` must contain only integers.
- The value of `k` must be a positive integer and should not exceed the length of the list.
- If the input list is empty or `k` is invalid, the function should raise a ValueError with an appropriate message.
- The function should not use any built-in sorting functions like `sorted()` or `list.sort()`. Instead, it should implement a simple sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort, to sort the list.

Write a Python program that automates the process of playing a mobile game where the player needs to jump from one platform to another by simulating screen taps. The game is played on an Android device, and the distance of the jump is proportional to the duration of the screen tap. The program should use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to interact with the device.

The program should include the following functionalities:

1. Capture the current game screen using `adb` and save it as an image file.
2. Display the captured image in a Matplotlib window.
3. Allow the user to click on two points on the Matplotlib window to mark the starting and ending points of the jump.
4. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points.
5. Simulate a screen tap with a duration proportional to the calculated distance to perform the jump in the game.
6. Update the displayed image after the jump to reflect the new game state.

The program should be able to repeatedly perform these steps, allowing the user to play the game through the Matplotlib interface.

Write a function `most_common_letter` that finds the most common lowercase letter in a given string. The string may contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace, but only lowercase letters should be considered when determining the most common letter. If there are multiple letters with the same highest frequency, return the one that comes first alphabetically.

The function should take a single argument `text` which is a string, and return a single character which is the most common lowercase letter. If the string does not contain any lowercase letters, the function should return an empty string.

For example:
- `most_common_letter(""Hello World!"")` should return `""l""`, as the most common lowercase letter is 'l'.
- `most_common_letter(""One"")` should return `""e""`, as all letters occur only once, and 'e' comes first alphabetically.

You are given a grid of size `10^6 x 10^6` and a list of blocked cells, where each cell in the grid is represented by a pair of integers `[x, y]`. The grid is so large that it is impractical to represent it explicitly. You are also given a source cell and a target cell. Your task is to determine if it is possible to escape from the source to the target by moving up, down, left, or right, without entering any blocked cells.

Write a function `isEscapePossible(blocked, source, target)` that returns `True` if it is possible to escape from the source to the target, and `False` otherwise. You may assume that the source and target cells are not blocked.

The escape is considered possible if:
- The target can be reached from the source by only moving through non-blocked cells.
- The Manhattan distance between the source and any cell visited during the search does not exceed 200. This is because if the Manhattan distance exceeds 200, it is assumed that there is enough space to navigate around the blocked cells.

The function should be efficient enough to handle a large number of blocked cells without running into time limit exceeded (TLE) errors.

In this solution, we use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the grid from the source to the target. We use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles and to ensure we do not revisit cells. The `manhattan` static method is used to calculate the Manhattan distance between two cells, which is used to determine if we have moved too far from the source. The `isEscapePossible` method initializes the blocked cells as a set for efficient lookup and then performs two DFS searches: one from the source to the target and another from the target to the source. If both searches succeed, the function returns `True`, indicating that escape is possible.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function named `send_video_and_cleanup` that sends a video file to a chat in a messaging application and then deletes the video file from the local storage. The function should use a messaging application's bot interface to send the video.

The function should accept the following parameters:
- `bot`: An instance of the bot interface that has a method `send_video` which takes `chat_id`, `video`, and `caption` as parameters.
- `chat_id`: The unique identifier for the chat where the video will be sent.
- `video_path`: The file path to the video that needs to be sent.
- `caption`: A string that will be used as the caption for the video in the chat.

The `send_video` method of the bot interface should simulate sending the video to the chat and print a message indicating that the video has been sent along with the caption.

After sending the video, the function should delete the video file from the local storage.

Include error handling to manage the case where the video file does not exist or the bot interface encounters an error while sending the video.

Write a Python function named `generate_trading_signals` that analyzes stock price changes and generates trading signals based on a given threshold. The function should take a Pandas DataFrame containing stock price percentage changes as input and add a new column to the DataFrame with the trading signals.

The trading signals are determined as follows:
- If the percentage change is greater than the threshold, the signal is `1` (indicating a 'buy' signal).
- If the percentage change is less than the negative threshold, the signal is `-1` (indicating a 'sell' signal).
- If the percentage change is within the threshold bounds, the signal is `0` (indicating a 'hold' signal).

The function should also take an optional parameter `threshold` that sets the percentage change required to trigger a buy or sell signal. The default value of the threshold should be `0.05` (5%).

The DataFrame is expected to have columns representing different stocks with their respective percentage changes.

For example, given the following DataFrame `df`:

```
            AAPL    GOOGL    AMZN
2023-01-01  0.06    0.04     0.07

2023-01-03  0.02    0.03     0.04
```

Calling `generate_trading_signals(df)` should add a new column `Signal` to `df` with the trading signals:

```
            AAPL    GOOGL    AMZN    Signal

You are tasked with creating a script that simulates the process of populating a mock database with user information. The database is accessible through a REST API endpoint, and you need to send POST requests to add new user data. Each user should have a name, city, address, and postal code. The script should attempt to create a specified number of user entries.

Write a Python script that meets the following requirements:

1. Generate a random full name for each user using the `names` package.
2. Generate a random address for each user using the `random_address` package. The address should include city, address line 1, and postal code.
3. Send a POST request to a local API endpoint with the generated user data.
4. Handle any `KeyError` exceptions that may occur if the address data is missing any required fields.
5. Limit the rate of requests to avoid overwhelming the server (e.g., by waiting a short period of time between requests).
6. Print the HTTP status code for each POST request to monitor the success or failure of data insertion.
7. Ensure the script prints ""Done!"" after attempting to create all user entries.

# Define the number of addresses to create
create_addresses = 1000

# Loop to create and send the specified number of user entries
for r in range(create_addresses):
    # Generate a random full name
    _name = names.get_full_name()
    
    # Generate a random address
    try:
        addr = real_random_address()
        payload = {

        response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
        
        # Print the HTTP status code
        print(response.status_code)

    # Wait for 0.1 seconds before the next request
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Print ""Done!"" after all entries have been attempted
print(""Done!"")
```

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have a local server running with an endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/new` that accepts POST requests with the expected payload structure. The server should return appropriate HTTP status codes based on the success or failure of data insertion.

Since setting up such a server is beyond the scope of this code snippet, we will not provide explicit test cases. However, if such a server were available, you would expect the script to print a series of HTTP status codes (e.g., `200` for successful requests) and potentially some error messages for missing fields, followed by ""Done!"" when the script completes.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python module that provides a set of utility functions to manage and read configuration data for a test environment. The module should be able to read configuration data from an INI file and provide this data to test cases in a testing framework such as pytest. The configuration data should include a base URL for API testing and database connection parameters.

The module should include the following functionalities:
1. A function to read a value from an INI file given a section and an option.
2. Pytest fixtures to provide:
   - The base URL for API testing as a session-scoped fixture.
   - The database connection parameters as a session-scoped fixture.
   - A `BaseRequests` instance for making HTTP requests that manages cookies automatically, also as a session-scoped fixture.

Write a Python program that simulates the process of creating a fill-dip noise (FDN) to mask a target audio signal. The program should take three audio files as input: the target audio file, the masker audio file, and the fill-dip noise audio file. The program should adjust the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the masker audio file to a specified level relative to the target audio file, generate the fill-dip noise based on the target and masker audio files, and then mix the target, masker, and fill-dip noise audio files together. The program should output two audio files: one with the mixed audio (target + masker + FDN) and one with just the fill-dip noise.

- `name`: A human-readable string representing the name of the sorting option (e.g., 'Relevance', 'Price: Low to High', 'Customer Ratings').
- `order`: A string representing the order of the sorting (e.g., 'highest', 'lowest').
- `selected`: A boolean indicating whether this sorting option is currently selected.

Additionally, create a unit test class `TestListingResponseSort` using the `unittest` framework to test the `ListingResponseSort` class. The test class should include methods to set up test cases, tear them down, and create instances of `ListingResponseSort` with both required and optional parameters. It should also include a test method to verify the instantiation of `ListingResponseSort` objects.

Create a Python class `ConfigMaker` that generates configurations of atoms for molecular simulations. The class should be able to read configuration types, lattice vectors, basis atoms, simulation box dimensions, and atom type mappings from separate files and use this information to create a list of `Atoms` objects from the ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) package.

The class should have the following methods:

1. `__init__(self)`: Initializes the `ConfigMaker` instance, reads the configuration files, and prepares the data structures.
2. `parse_configtypes(self)`: Reads the `CONFIGTYPES` file and stores the configuration types.
3. `parse_config(self)`: Reads the `LATVEC`, `BASIS`, `BOX`, and `TYPEMAP` files to store lattice vectors, basis atoms, box dimensions, and atom type mappings, respectively.
4. `add(self, symbols, positions, box)`: Adds a new configuration to the list of `Atoms` objects. The `symbols` parameter is a list of chemical symbols, `positions` is a list of atomic positions, and `box` is the simulation box dimensions.
5. `write_configs(self, filename)`: Writes the list of `Atoms` objects to a file in a specified format.

The class should also handle any necessary conversions, such as scaling lattice vectors and box dimensions by their respective scale factors.

Write a function `sort_list_by_mode` that takes a list of integers `lst` and a string `mode` as its parameters. The `mode` parameter specifies the sorting behavior of the function as follows:

- If `mode` is `""Asc""`, the function should return a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order.
- If `mode` is `""Des""`, the function should return a new list with the integers sorted in descending order.
- If `mode` is `""None""`, the function should return the list as is, without any sorting.

The function should handle the following edge cases:

- If `lst` is empty, return an empty list regardless of the `mode`.
- If `mode` is not one of the specified strings (`""Asc""`, `""Des""`, or `""None""`), raise a `ValueError` with the message `""Invalid mode""`.

Design a web application that generates acronyms from user-provided phrases. The application should allow users to input a phrase and specify a ""clip"" value, which determines the maximum length of each word in the acronym. The acronym generation should consider a predefined dictionary of words to ensure that the resulting acronym is meaningful. The application should use multiprocessing to handle the acronym generation in the background and Flask for the web interface.

The acronym generation function `genAcronym` should take a list of words, a clip value, and a dictionary, and return a list of possible acronyms. Each acronym should be a tuple containing the original acronym, a list of word components (each component is a tuple with the word and the index where the acronym letter is found), the processed acronym with '?' for letters that could not be matched to dictionary words, and a boolean indicating if the acronym is valid (all letters matched to dictionary words).

The web application should display the results to the user, including the original acronym, the processed acronym with '?' for unmatched letters, and the word components for each letter of the acronym. If the acronym is not valid, it should indicate which letters could not be matched.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to create a mock `genAcronym` function that simulates the behavior of the actual acronym generation function. You would also need to create a test dictionary file `dictionary.txt` with some sample words.

For the Flask application, you would need to run the application and manually test the web interface by entering phrases and clip values, and verifying that the results are displayed correctly on the web page.

Design a Python program that validates a collection of STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) entries for a given Earth Engine public data catalog. The program should perform the following checks on each STAC entry:

1. **ID Check**: Ensure that each STAC entry has a valid 'id' field that is not prefixed with the `UNKNOWN_ID` string.
2. **Type Check**: Verify that the 'type' field of each STAC entry matches one of the `StacType` enum values.
3. **GEE Type Check**: Confirm that the 'gee:type' field of each STAC entry matches one of the `GeeType` enum values or is absent (in which case it defaults to `GeeType.NONE`).
4. **Non-Commercial Check**: Check if the dataset ID of each STAC entry is listed in the non-commercial datasets list.

The program should report any issues found during the validation process, categorizing them as either 'warning' or 'error' based on the severity of the issue. The output should be a list of `Issue` instances, each representing a specific problem found in a STAC entry.

Design a Python class that represents a simple database model for a sports team management system. The class should be called `Team` and should extend from Django's `models.Model`.

Design a Python program that uses computer vision techniques to track a person's eye movements and estimate their gaze direction in real-time. The program should use the MediaPipe library to detect facial landmarks, specifically focusing on the eyes and pupils. The program should be able to process video frames, detect the eyes and pupils, calculate the gaze angle, and visually indicate the detected eyes, pupils, and gaze direction on the video frames.

The program should be encapsulated in a class `EyeTracker` with the following functionalities:

1. Initialization with the dimensions of the video frames.
2. Detection of facial landmarks in a given video frame.
3. Drawing of the facial mesh, eyes, and pupils on the video frame if specified.
4. Calculation and storage of the eye and pupil centers, as well as the gaze angle.
5. Visualization of the eyes, pupils, and gaze direction with circles and arrows.

The `EyeTracker` class should be able to work with both static images and real-time video streams. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution using static images.

The provided code snippet is a starting point for two views in your Django application: one for creating a new course and another for creating a new deliverable.

Your goal is to enhance the given code snippet by implementing the following features:

1. Modify the `curso` view to accept `nombre` (name of the course) and `camada` (batch number) as parameters from the request. The view should create a new `Curso` object with these parameters and save it to the database.

2. Modify the `entregables` view to accept `nombre` (name of the deliverable) and `fechaEntrega` (delivery date) as parameters from the request. The view should create a new `Entregable` object with these parameters and save it to the database.

3. Ensure that both views return a JSON response indicating the success of the operation, including the details of the created objects.

4. Write test cases to verify that the views correctly handle the creation of `Curso` and `Entregable` objects.

In this solution, we have defined two views: `CustomLoginView` and `RegisterPage`. The `CustomLoginView` is a simple extension of Django's `LoginView` with a specified template. The `RegisterPage` handles both GET and POST requests, displaying a registration form and processing user registration, respectively.

The `urlpatterns` list includes paths for both views, and we have provided test cases using Django's `TestCase` class to verify that the registration and login pages are accessible and that user registration works correctly.

Design a Python class named `Transport` that simulates a transportation vehicle with certain characteristics and behaviors. The class should have the following features:

1. The `Transport` class should have an initializer (`__init__`) that can accept two optional arguments: `speed` (in km/h) and `distance` (in km). If no arguments are provided, the `speed` should be randomly set between 1 and 500 km/h, and the `distance` should be randomly set between 1 and 10000 km.

2. The class should have a method named `ideal_time` that calculates the ideal time (in hours) to cover the distance at the given speed, assuming there are no delays or interruptions.

3. The class should have a method named `out` that takes a file object as an argument and writes the speed, distance, and ideal time to cover the distance into the file in a formatted string.

4. The class should handle any potential errors that might occur during file operations in the `out` method gracefully, without crashing the program.

Design a RESTful API for a task management system using Flask and Flask-JWT-Extended. The system should allow users to register, log in, refresh their JWT tokens, and perform CRUD operations on tasks. Each task should have an associated user, and users should only be able to interact with their own tasks. The API should enforce authentication and provide meaningful error messages for various failure cases.

The API should include the following endpoints:

1. `POST /api/v2/register`: Registers a new user with an email and password.
2. `POST /api/v2/login`: Authenticates a user and returns JWT access and refresh tokens.
3. `POST /api/v2/refresh`: Refreshes an access token using a refresh token.
4. `GET /api/v2/identity`: Retrieves the identity of the current user.
5. `POST /api/v2/tasks`: Creates a new task for the authenticated user.
6. `GET /api/v2/tasks`: Retrieves all tasks for the authenticated user.
7. `PUT /api/v2/tasks/<task_id>`: Updates a task with the given `task_id` for the authenticated user.
8. `DELETE /api/v2/tasks/<task_id>`: Deletes a task with the given `task_id` for the authenticated user.

The `UserModel` should have a method `check_password` that verifies the provided password against the stored password hash. The `create_task`, `get_user_tasks`, `modify_task`, and `delete_task` functions should be implemented to handle task-related operations.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the following test cases:

1. Register a new user with a POST request to `/api/v2/register` with a JSON payload containing `email` and `password`.
2. Log in with the registered user credentials using a POST request to `/api/v2/login` and verify that access and refresh tokens are returned.
3. Use the access token to authenticate a GET request to `/api/v2/identity` and verify that the user's identity is returned.
4. Create a new task with a POST request to `/api/v2/tasks` with a JSON payload containing `title` and verify that the task is created.
5. Retrieve all tasks for the authenticated user with a GET request to `/api/v2/tasks` and verify that the created task is in the response.
6. Update a task with a PUT request to `/api/v2/tasks/<task_id>` with a JSON payload containing a new `title` and verify that the task is updated.
7. Delete a task with a DELETE request to `/api/v2/tasks/<task_id>` and verify that the task is deleted.

Please note that these test cases assume that the Flask application is running and accessible. You may need to use tools like `curl`, Postman, or write a Python script using `requests` to perform these tests.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a game, a hero is fighting battles against monsters. The hero starts with a certain amount of energy and wins a battle by spending energy equal to the distance to the monster. After every third battle won, the hero gains additional energy equal to the number of battles won so far. The game ends when the hero either runs out of energy or decides to stop fighting.

Write a function `calculate_battles` that takes an initial amount of energy and a list of distances to monsters. The function should return the number of battles won and the remaining energy of the hero. If the hero does not have enough energy to fight the next monster, the function should return the current number of battles won and the remaining energy without attempting to fight the monster.

Design a Django application for a messaging system where users can send messages to each other. Each message should have a sender, a recipient, a subject, and a body. The sender and recipient should be selected from a list of registered users (profiles). The message should also track whether it has been read and the time it was sent. Implement the `Message` model with the following requirements:

1. The `Message` model should have a foreign key to the `Profile` model for the sender.
2. The `Message` model should have a field to store the recipient's user ID.
3. The `Message` model should have a `subject` field with a maximum length of 50 characters.
4. The `Message` model should have a `body` field with a maximum length of 1000 characters.
5. The `Message` model should have a `read` field to indicate whether the message has been read.
6. The `Message` model should have a `sent_time` field that automatically stores the date and time when the message was sent.
7. Implement a method `mark_as_read` within the `Message` model that sets the `read` field to `True`.
8. Write a Django form `MessageForm` to create a new message with the fields `recipient`, `subject`, and `body`.

- `list`: Lists all the tasks in the To-Do list with their status (done or not done).
- `done task_number`: Marks the task with the given task number as done.

Create a Django view function that handles the submission of a contact form and the retrieval of social media links to be displayed on the contact page. The contact form should collect the user's name, email, phone, subject, and message. The form data should be validated and saved to a `ContactInformation` model if valid. If the form submission is not valid, an error message should be displayed. Additionally, the view should retrieve all social media links from a `SocialMediaLink` model and pass them to the template context.

The `ContactInformation` model has the following fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `subject`, and `message`. The `SocialMediaLink` model has the fields: `name` and `url`.

The view function should be named `contact` and should handle both GET and POST requests. On a GET request, it should provide an empty form to the user. On a POST request, it should process the submitted form data.

Design a text generation system using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The system should be capable of learning from a given text corpus and generating new text sequences that mimic the style and content of the original corpus. The corpus will be provided in a JSON file containing Wikipedia content. The system should include the following functionalities:

1. Download the dataset from an AWS S3 bucket.
2. Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and filtering out stopwords.
3. Prepare the data for training by creating sequences of a fixed length and their corresponding next characters.
4. Build and train an LSTM model on the prepared data.
5. Save the trained model to an AWS S3 bucket.
6. Generate a shutdown command for the system after the training is complete.

The system should be configurable through environment variables, including the number of GPUs and CPUs to use, the S3 bucket names for the dataset and the model, and the shutdown time. The system should also log its progress at each step.

Write a Python program that scrapes a website for a specific JavaScript file, downloads it if it's not already cached locally, and then attempts to convert the JavaScript code to Python using the `js2py` library.

The program should follow these steps:

1. Send an HTTP GET request to a given URL.
2. Parse the HTML response to find a `<script>` tag with a source (`src`) that includes the text ""main"" and ""chunk.js"".
3. If such a script tag is found, construct the full URL of the JavaScript file.
4. Check if the JavaScript file is already downloaded and saved locally. If not, download the file and save it using the filename extracted from the `src` attribute.
5. If the file is already cached, skip the download.
6. Attempt to convert the JavaScript code to Python using the `js2py` library and print the result.

The program should handle any exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request, file operations, or JavaScript to Python conversion process.

Create a Python program that initializes a Tornado web application with custom settings. The application should be able to read configuration settings from a separate configuration module and use these settings to set up the application environment. The configuration should include template path, run mode, logging level, logging path, logging filename, MySQL configuration, and handler paths.

The program should also include a `TornadoContext` class that is responsible for loading web request handlers based on the provided handler paths. Assume that the `TornadoContext` class has a method `load_handlers` that returns a list of handler tuples (URL pattern, request handler class) for Tornado to use.

Write the `Application` class that inherits from `tornado.web.Application` and uses the settings from the configuration module to initialize the application. The configuration module is represented by the `conf` import in the given code snippet.

In a vehicle management system, there is a need to track the maintenance programs associated with different vehicle models. Each vehicle model can be associated with a single maintenance program, which outlines the services and inspections required for that model.

Your task is to create a Python class that represents a vehicle model and its associated maintenance program. The class should be named `FleetVehicleModel` and should inherit from a base class `Model`. The `FleetVehicleModel` class should have an attribute `program_id` that represents the link to the maintenance program.

Additionally, create a class `VmsProgram` that represents the maintenance program. This class should have the following attributes:
- `name`: A string representing the name of the maintenance program.
- `services`: A list of strings representing the services included in the program.
- `inspections`: A list of strings representing the inspections required by the program.

Implement the following features:
- A method in `FleetVehicleModel` to assign a maintenance program to the vehicle model.
- A method in `FleetVehicleModel` to retrieve the details of the associated maintenance program.
- A method in `VmsProgram` to add a service to the program.
- A method in `VmsProgram` to add an inspection to the program.

Design a Python class `ColorPicker` that represents an HTML color picker widget. The class should inherit from three parent classes: `DescriptionWidget`, `ValueWidget`, and `CoreWidget`. The `ColorPicker` class should have the following attributes:

- `value`: A string representing the color value in HTML format (e.g., ""black"", ""#FFFFFF""). It should have a default value of ""black"" and include a help description ""The color value."".
- `concise`: A boolean indicating whether to display a concise version of the color picker with just a color selector. It should include a help description ""Display short version with just a color selector."".
- `disabled`: A boolean indicating whether the color picker is disabled (i.e., user changes are not allowed). It should have a default value of `False` and include a help description ""Enable or disable user changes."".

Additionally, the class should have two private Unicode attributes `_view_name` and `_model_name` with default values ""ColorPickerView"" and ""ColorPickerModel"", respectively. These attributes should be tagged with `sync=True` to indicate that they should be synchronized with the frontend.

Design a Python program that simulates a simplified version of the card game Blackjack. The game should be played between a single player and the dealer (computer). The goal of the game is to obtain cards whose total value is as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player can decide to ""hit"" to take another card or ""stand"" to end their turn. The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.

The program should use a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the game state and accept user input. The GUI should show the player's and dealer's hands, the current score, and buttons to ""Deal"", ""Hit"", and ""Stand"". The game should keep track of the player's score, adding 1 for a win, subtracting 1 for a loss, and changing nothing for a tie. The game ends when the player chooses to start a new deal or closes the application.

Design a Python function `create_and_cleanup_vmax_volume` that automates the process of creating a new volume on an EMC VMAX storage array, and ensures that any volumes created during the process are cleaned up afterwards. The function should adhere to the following specifications:

1. The function should take two arguments:
    - `size_in_gb`: The desired size of the volume to be created, in gigabytes.
    - `test_case`: An object that has an `addCleanup` method, which is used to register cleanup callbacks.

2. The function should read the VMAX configuration from a YAML file, as done in the `_read_vmax_yaml` function provided in the code snippet.

3. The function should create a new volume with the specified size, rounded up to the nearest allocation unit as determined by the `vmax_allocation_unit` function.

4. The function should register a cleanup callback using the `test_case.addCleanup` method to ensure that the created volume is deleted after the test case is completed.

5. The function should return the ID of the created volume.

6. Include error handling to manage any exceptions that may occur during the volume creation and cleanup process, and print appropriate error messages.

7. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Create a web application using Flask and SQLAlchemy that allows users to submit feedback about a dealer. The feedback should include the customer's name, the dealer's name, a rating (from 1 to 5), and optional comments. The application should have two routes: one for displaying the feedback form and another for processing the submitted feedback.

The feedback data should be stored in a PostgreSQL database. If the customer or dealer fields are left empty, the form should not be submitted, and the user should be prompted to fill in the required fields. If the form is submitted successfully, the user should be redirected to a success page.

Ensure that the `Feedback` model is correctly defined and that the application is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database in development mode. Also, include error handling for database connection issues.

Write a Python program that generates a dependency graph for a given source file in a software project. The program should recursively scan the source file and its included headers to build a graph of dependencies, which can then be output as a DOT file for visualization with graph-drawing software like Graphviz.

The program should support the following features:
- Include paths: Specify additional directories to search for included files.
- Library paths: Specify directories to search for libraries that may contain symbols referenced in the source files.
- Output file: Specify the name of the output DOT file.
- Exclude regular expressions: Specify a regular expression pattern to exclude certain files from the dependency graph.
- Maximum depth: Limit the recursive scanning to a certain depth.
- Forward declarations: Include forward-declared classes in the dependency graph.
- Find libraries: Attempt to guess which libraries contain the symbols used in the source files.
- Libraries only: Output only the libraries in the dependency graph, not the individual classes or files.
- Suppress unknown libraries: Do not include classes or files in the output if their containing library cannot be determined.

The program should be able to handle command-line arguments to set these features and should provide helpful error messages for incorrect usage.

Design a Python class called `ScanManager` that manages different types of file scans. The `ScanManager` should be able to register different scan types and execute them based on the file extension. The supported scan types are `BinaryScan`, `FileScan`, `JsonScan`, `ArrowScan`, `DocScan`, `MaterializedScan`, and `PandasScan`. Each scan type is specialized in handling specific file formats:

- `BinaryScan`: Handles binary files (`.bin`).
- `FileScan`: Handles generic files without a specific format.
- `JsonScan`: Handles JSON files (`.json`).
- `ArrowScan`: Handles Apache Arrow files (`.arrow`).
- `DocScan`: Handles document files (`.docx`, `.pdf`).
- `MaterializedScan`: Handles materialized views, not tied to a specific file extension.
- `PandasScan`: Handles CSV files (`.csv`).

The `ScanManager` should have the following methods:

- `register_scan(scan_type, file_extensions)`: Registers a scan type along with the associated file extensions.
- `execute_scan(file_path)`: Executes the appropriate scan based on the file extension of the given `file_path`. If the file extension is not recognized, it should raise a `ValueError`.

Each scan type class should have an `execute` method that simulates scanning the file and returns a string indicating the type of scan and the file that was scanned (e.g., `""BinaryScan executed for file: example.bin""`).

Create a Python class `FTPDirectoryCreator` that encapsulates the functionality to create a directory on an FTP server. The class should be designed to handle the creation of a directory given a path and an FTP session object. It should also handle any errors that occur during the directory creation process, such as the directory already existing, and log appropriate messages.

The class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, path, session)`: Constructor that takes a `path` for the directory to be created and an `FTPConnection` `session`.
- `run(self)`: Method that attempts to create the directory on the FTP server. If successful, it should return information about the created directory. If an error occurs, it should return an error message and a traceback.

The class should use the `os` module to resolve absolute paths and the `traceback` module to format exceptions. It should also have a `logger` attribute for logging debug messages and a `get_ftp_connection` method that returns an FTP connection object.

Write a Python function `normalize_paths` that takes a list of file system paths and returns a new list with each path ""normalized"". Normalizing a path involves removing any redundant separators and up-level references without changing the absolute path meaning.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:

- The function should be named `normalize_paths`.
- The function should take a single argument, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a file system path.
- The function should return a new list of strings, where each string is the normalized version of the corresponding path in the input list.
- The function should use the `os.path.normpath` method to normalize each path.
- The function should handle any exceptions that may occur during normalization and print an error message for any invalid paths, but it should not raise any exceptions to the caller.

Here is the function signature:

```python
def normalize_paths(paths: list) -> list:
    """"""
    Normalizes a list of file system paths.

    Parameters:
    paths (list): A list of strings representing file system paths.

    Returns:
    list: A list of normalized file system paths.

    Parameters:
    paths (list): A list of strings representing file system paths.

normalized_test_paths = normalize_paths(test_paths)
for original, normalized in zip(test_paths, normalized_test_paths):
    print(f'Original: {original!r}\nNormalized: {normalized!r}\n')

Write a Python module named `motion_control` that provides utility functions for a stepper motor control system. The module should include the following functions:

1. `steps_to_mm(steps)`: Converts the number of steps taken by a stepper motor into millimeters based on a predefined conversion factor `STEPS_MM` from a configuration module `drawpi.config`.

2. `mm_to_steps(mm)`: Converts a distance in millimeters into the number of steps a stepper motor needs to take, rounding to the nearest whole number of steps.

3. `chunks(l, n)`: Splits a given list `l` into chunks of size `n`, yielding each chunk as a generator.

4. `frequency_to_delay(frequency)`: Converts a frequency in Hertz (cycles per second) to a delay in microseconds between pulses, which is useful for controlling the speed of the stepper motor.

The module should also include a `main` function that demonstrates the use of each utility function with test cases. Assume that the `drawpi.config` module contains a constant `STEPS_MM` that defines the number of steps per millimeter for the stepper motor.

    Args:
        l (list): The list to be split into chunks.
        n (int): The size of each chunk.
        
    Yields:
        list: A chunk of the original list of size n or less.

        yield l[i:i + n]

To run the test cases, you would need to have a `drawpi.config` module with a `STEPS_MM` constant defined. Here's an example of what the `drawpi.config` module might look like:

```python
# drawpi/config.py

# Define the number of steps per millimeter for the stepper motor
STEPS_MM = 80
```

When you run the `motion_control.main()` function, it should output the results of the test cases, demonstrating the functionality of each utility function.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function named `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

The function should take a single string argument and return a boolean value: `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

The function should ignore all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when determining if a string is a palindrome.

For example:
- `is_palindrome(""A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"")` should return `True`.

Create a simple PyQt5 application that displays a window with a single button. When the button is clicked, the application should print out the current position and size of the window, as well as the position and size of the button within the window. The output should include the window's absolute position on the screen, the position relative to its own geometry, and the position including the window frame.

The application should be structured as follows:
- A main window (`QWidget`) with a title ""PyQt5 Position and Size Reporter"".
- A button (`QPushButton`) labeled ""Report Metrics"".
- When the button is clicked, the application should print the following information to the console:
  1. The x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the window, the width, and the height of the window.
  2. The x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the window's geometry, the width, and the height of the window's geometry.

Design a Python class `LinearRegressionDiagnostics` that extends the functionality of a simple linear regression model to include various diagnostic measures. The class should be able to fit a linear regression model to the provided training data, calculate and store the model's coefficients, and provide several diagnostic statistics to evaluate the model's performance and assumptions.

The class should include the following features:

1. Fit a linear regression model to the training data.
2. Calculate the F-statistic and its associated p-value to assess the overall significance of the model.
3. Calculate the t-statistics and their associated p-values for each coefficient to assess their individual significance.
4. Calculate Cook's distance for each observation to identify potential outliers or influential points.
5. Calculate leverage values to assess the influence of each observation on the model's predictions.
6. Calculate studentized residuals to identify outliers in the response variable.
7. Predict the response variable for a new set of observations.

The class should handle both numerical and categorical predictors. If a categorical predictor is specified, the class should create dummy variables for the categories and include them in the model.

Design a match-3 puzzle game called ""GemSwap"" where the player swaps adjacent gems on a grid to form a line of three or more gems of the same color, which then disappear, and new gems fall from the top to fill the grid. The game should be implemented in Python using object-oriented programming principles.

The game should have the following features:
- A grid of size 8x8 with randomly colored gems.
- The ability to swap two adjacent gems (horizontally or vertically) to create a match.
- When a match is made, the gems should disappear, and the player's score should increase.
- New gems should fall from the top to fill the empty spaces.

Write a program that validates a list of passwords based on two different policies and counts how many passwords are valid according to each policy.

The input will be a list of strings, where each string represents a password policy and a password, separated by a space. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid according to the first policy. For the second policy, the policy indicates two positions (1-indexed), exactly one of which must contain the given letter for the password to be valid.

The format of each string in the list is as follows:
- ""1-3 a: abcde"" - this means the password ""abcde"" must contain the letter ""a"" at least 1 time and at most 3 times for the first policy, and it must contain the letter ""a"" at either position 1 or position 3 (but not both) for the second policy.

Design a smart environmental control system for a building with multiple rooms. The system should be able to maintain the temperature of each room within a specified range by controlling heating and cooling devices. The system should also be capable of updating the setpoints for temperature control at random intervals, simulating a dynamic environment where user preferences or external conditions may change.

The building layout consists of two different configurations: a single-room environment and an eight-room environment. The single-room environment has one outside area and one adjacent room, while the eight-room environment has one outside area and eight rooms arranged in two rows of four, with specific adjacency relationships.

The system should include the following components:
- `Room`: A class representing a room with properties such as name, temperature, heat capacity, position, and whether it is static or dynamic (i.e., outside or inside).
- `Environment`: A base class for the environment that includes methods for initializing rooms and equipment, updating setpoints, and running simulations.
- `SingleRoomEnvironment` and `EightRoomEnvironment`: Subclasses of `Environment` that define the specific configurations of rooms and their interconnections.
- Temperature sensors and controllers for heating and cooling, provided by two different technology vendors (`Asys` and `Btech`).
- A method to update the temperature setpoints at random intervals based on a Poisson distribution, simulating random user interactions or environmental changes.

The system should be able to run a simulation using historical temperature data and produce a graph representing the rooms and their connections.

Implement a class `Solution` that contains methods to sort a stack using recursion. The stack should be sorted such that the largest element is at the top of the stack. The class should include the following methods:

1. `sortedInsert(self, s, element)`: A helper method that inserts an element into the stack `s` in sorted order. This method assumes that the stack is already sorted.

2. `sortStack(self, s)`: A method that sorts the stack `s` using recursion. It should use the `sortedInsert` method to insert elements at the correct position.

3. `sorted(self, s)`: A method that sorts the stack `s` and then reverses it so that the smallest element is at the top of the stack.

The input to the program will be a series of test cases, each consisting of a stack represented as a list of integers. The program should output the sorted stack for each test case, with the smallest element at the top.

Write a Python program that demonstrates the concept of method overriding in object-oriented programming. You are required to define a base class `Vehicle` with a method `description` that prints a generic message. Then, define two subclasses `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit from `Vehicle`. Each subclass should override the `description` method to print a message specific to the type of vehicle it represents.

Additionally, implement a function `print_vehicle_description(vehicle)` that takes an instance of `Vehicle` (or its subclasses) and calls the `description` method on it. Use this function to demonstrate polymorphism by passing instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle` and observing the overridden behavior.

Write a Python script that acts as a ROS (Robot Operating System) service client to request a map from a map service server. The script should initialize a ROS node, wait for the map service to become available, send a request to the service, and then print the received map data.

The map service is assumed to be provided under the service name '/static_map' and should adhere to the `nav_msgs/GetMap` service type, which includes a `GetMapRequest` for the request and a `GetMapResponse` for the response containing the map data.

The script should handle any exceptions that may occur during the service call, such as service unavailability or communication errors, by printing an appropriate error message.

Write a function `evaluate_operations` that simulates a simple stack-based operation evaluator. The function takes a single string `s` as input, which contains a series of integer values and the character 'Z'. Each integer value should be pushed onto the stack, and whenever the character 'Z' is encountered, the top value of the stack should be popped (removed). The function should return the sum of the values remaining in the stack after processing the entire string.

The input string `s` will contain space-separated tokens, where each token is either an integer or the character 'Z'. The character 'Z' will only appear if there is at least one integer in the stack to be removed. The function should handle an empty input string and return 0 in such a case.

For example:
- If the input string is ""5 6 7 Z"", the function should return 11, as the 'Z' would remove the last pushed value '7', leaving '5' and '6' in the stack.
- If the input string is ""1 2 3 Z Z"", the function should return 1, as the two 'Z's would remove '3' and '2' from the stack.

For example, a smile represented by `"":)""` should be converted to `"":smile:""`, and a sad face represented by `"":(""` should be converted to `"":sad:""`. If the word does not match any of the predefined emoji representations, it should be left unchanged.

The program should also include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

You are tasked with creating a simple Flask web application that allows users to guess the name of a band. The application should have two routes: the home page (`/` or `/index`) where the user can submit their guess through a form, and the result page (`/band`) where the user is informed if their guess was correct or not.

The application should use a `BandForm` class from the `app.forms` module, which is a Flask-WTF form with a single field `band` for the user's guess. The correct band name is ""meshuggah"". If the user guesses correctly, they should be presented with a message ""You were right!"". If the guess is incorrect, the message should be ""Try again!"".

Write the Flask application code following the guidelines below:

- Import necessary packages at the beginning of the code snippet.
- Define the `BandForm` class with the required field.
- Create the Flask application instance and configure the secret key.
- Define the two routes (`/` and `/band`) with their respective view functions.
- Use `render_template` to render HTML templates for the home page and the result page.
- Validate the form submission and display the appropriate message on the result page.
- Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

**Test Cases**:

Since this is a Flask application, the test cases would involve running the application and interacting with it through a web browser or using tools like `curl` or `httpie` to send requests to the application. However, for the sake of this example, we will not provide actual test case code but rather describe what the test cases would do:

1. Access the home page (`/` or `/index`) and ensure that the form is displayed.
2. Submit the form with the correct band name ""meshuggah"" and verify that the result page shows the message ""You were right!"".
3. Submit the form with an incorrect band name and verify that the result page shows the message ""Try again!"".

Please note that for a real-world application, you would also want to write unit tests for the form validation logic and the view functions, and you might use a testing framework like `pytest` along with Flask's test client to simulate requests to the application.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Python Flask application that serves as a marketplace for buying and selling mangos. The application should have the following features:

1. A homepage that welcomes users to the Mango Marketplace.
2. A form page where users can submit information about a mango they want to sell, including the mango's ID, total cost, quantity, country of origin, price per unit, image URL, commodity type, fixed overhead, and variable overhead costs.
3. A processing route that receives the form submission and displays the submitted information back to the user for confirmation.
4. A route that lists all available mangos for sale, fetched from a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
5. A route that intentionally raises an error for testing error handling.

Create a Python web application using the Streamlit library that provides an interactive interface for data visualization and processing. The application should have the following features:

1. A header that says ""Interactive Data Visualization App"".
2. A sidebar with options to choose between different mini-projects: 'Line Chart', 'Map Visualization', 'Terms and Conditions', and 'Long Process Simulation'.
3. When 'Line Chart' is selected, a random time series data for three variables should be generated and displayed as a line chart.
4. When 'Map Visualization' is selected, a scatter plot on a map should be displayed, showing random locations around a central point (latitude 37.76, longitude -122.4).
5. When 'Terms and Conditions' is selected, a link to a terms and conditions page should be displayed, along with a checkbox for the user to agree to the terms. Upon agreement, a simple DataFrame should be displayed.
6. When 'Long Process Simulation' is selected, simulate a long-running process with a progress bar and iterative updates to the interface.
7. Include a checkbox on the main page that, when checked, displays a readme section with information about the web app, including links to the app's GitHub repository and the developer's LinkedIn profile.

Write a Python function named `custom_product_range` that calculates the product of a sequence of terms defined by a custom term calculation function and a custom progression function. The function should take four parameters:

1. `start`: The starting value of the range (inclusive).
2. `end`: The ending value of the range (inclusive).
3. `term_function`: A function that takes an integer and returns the term to be included in the product.
4. `next_function`: A function that takes the current value and returns the next value in the progression.

The function should return the product of the terms from `start` to `end`, inclusive, where each term is calculated using `term_function` and the progression is determined by `next_function`.

For example, if `term_function` is a lambda function that squares its input and `next_function` is a lambda function that increments its input by 2, then `custom_product_range(1, 5, lambda x: x**2, lambda x: x + 2)` should return the product of the sequence [1^2, 3^2, 5^2], which is 225.

Additionally, write a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number using the `custom_product_range` function. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Create a simple banking application interface using PySimpleGUI that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as opening an account, accessing an existing account, and conducting transactions. The application should provide a graphical user interface where users can select the operation they want to perform and input the necessary details for that operation.

The application should have the following functionalities:
1. Open a new account by collecting the account number, account holder's name, initial deposit amount, and credit limit.
2. Access an existing account by entering the account number, account holder's name, and password.
3. Perform transactions on an accessed account, including:
   - Viewing the account balance (fixed for demonstration purposes at $2,000.00).
   - Making a transfer to another account by providing the bank code, account number, account holder's name, and transfer amount.
   - Requesting a new credit limit.

The application should display appropriate messages and print the details of the operations performed.

### 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note**: Do not modify the linked list.

**Follow up**:
Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e., constant) memory?

**Example**:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: The node with value 2

```

In the provided solution, the `detectCycle` function uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect a cycle in the linked list. If a cycle is detected, it then finds the entry point of the cycle and returns the corresponding node. If no cycle is detected, it returns `None`. The test cases verify that the solution works correctly for various scenarios.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Django database migration that creates a new model `ClassRoom` with the following requirements:

1. The `ClassRoom` model should have an `id` field that serves as the primary key. This field should be an auto-incrementing integer.
2. The model should have a `class_name` field that stores the name of the classroom as a string with a maximum length of 200 characters.
3. The `school` field should be a one-to-one relationship with another model called `School`. Assume that the `School` model exists in the same Django app named 'quiz'.
4. The `students` field should be a many-to-many relationship with a model called `SchoolProfile`. The related name for the reverse relationship from `SchoolProfile` to `ClassRoom` should be 'classrooms'.
5. The `teacher` field should be a one-to-one relationship with the `SchoolProfile` model. The related name for the reverse relationship from `SchoolProfile` to `ClassRoom` should be 'teacher_classroom'.
6. The combination of `school` and `class_name` should be unique across all `ClassRoom` instances.

Write a Django migration script that creates the `ClassRoom` model and enforces the unique constraint on the combination of `school` and `class_name`. Ensure that the migration script is compatible with Django's migration framework.

","

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('quiz', '0001_initial'),

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='ClassRoom',

                'unique_together': {('school', 'class_name')},
            },
        ),
    ]
```

**Test Cases**:

Since Django migrations are not typically tested with unit tests, and they are run with Django's `manage.py migrate` command, we will not provide explicit test cases here. However, after applying this migration, you can verify its correctness by checking the following:

1. The `ClassRoom` model should exist in your database schema.
2. The `class_name` field should accept strings up to 200 characters long.
3. The `school` field should reference the `School` model, and there should be a one-to-one relationship between them.
4. The `students` field should create a many-to-many relationship with the `SchoolProfile` model, and the related name should be 'classrooms'.
5. The `teacher` field should create a one-to-one relationship with the `SchoolProfile` model, and the related name should be 'teacher_classroom'.
6. The unique constraint on the combination of `school` and `class_name` should be enforced, meaning you cannot have two `ClassRoom` instances with the same `school` and `class_name`.

To verify the migration, you can run the following commands in your Django project:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then, you can use the Django shell to test the constraints:

```shell
python manage.py shell
```

Inside the shell, you can try creating `ClassRoom` instances and check if the constraints are applied:

```python
from quiz.models import School, SchoolProfile, ClassRoom

# Assuming School and SchoolProfile instances already exist
school = School.objects.first()
teacher = SchoolProfile.objects.first()

# Create a ClassRoom instance
classroom = ClassRoom.objects.create(class_name='Math 101', school=school, teacher=teacher)

# Try to create another ClassRoom with the same school and class_name
try:
    duplicate_classroom = ClassRoom.objects.create(class_name='Math 101', school=school, teacher=teacher)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # This should raise an exception due to the unique constraint

Implement a class `PoseNet` that uses a TensorFlow Lite model to perform pose estimation on an input image. The class should be able to:

1. Load a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for pose estimation.
2. Accept an input image and preprocess it to the required format for the model.
3. Run inference on the preprocessed image to obtain the heatmaps and offsets for the keypoints.
4. Post-process the heatmaps and offsets to extract the coordinates of the keypoints.
5. Filter the keypoints based on a confidence threshold and ensure they are within the image boundaries.
6. Return the keypoints that pass the confidence threshold, along with their confidence scores.

The keypoints should be returned as a NumPy array with shape `(joint_num, 3)`, where `joint_num` is the number of joints detected by the model, and the 3 values for each keypoint are `(x, y, confidence)`.

Create a Python script using Django's admin functionality to create a custom admin interface for a blogging platform. The platform consists of the following models: `Author`, `Category`, `Post`, `PostCategory`, and `Comment`. Each model should have a corresponding admin class that customizes the admin interface. The customizations should include:

1. `AuthorAdmin`: Display the list of authors with their `name` and `email`. Also, enable search by `name`.
2. `CategoryAdmin`: Display the list of categories with their `title`. Also, enable search by `title`.
3. `PostAdmin`: Display the list of posts with their `title`, `author`, and `date_created`. Enable search by `title` and `author__name`, and add a filter by `date_created`.
4. `PostCategoryAdmin`: No specific customizations are required; simply register the model.
5. `CommentAdmin`: Display the list of comments with their `author`, `post`, and `text`. Enable search by `post__title` and `author__name`, and add a filter by `post`.

Implement the admin classes and register them with the Django admin site. Ensure that the admin interface is user-friendly and provides the necessary functionalities as described.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Category, Post, PostCategory, Comment

### Test Cases:

Since the above code is for Django's admin interface, the test cases would be manual and involve checking the admin interface in a web browser after running the Django development server. Here are the steps to verify the solution:

1. Start the Django development server by running `python manage.py runserver`.
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
3. Log in with a superuser account.
4. Navigate to each of the registered models (`Author`, `Category`, `Post`, `PostCategory`, `Comment`) and verify the following:
   - For `Author`, ensure that the list displays `name` and `email`, and that you can search by `name`.
   - For `Category`, ensure that the list displays `title`, and that you can search by `title`.
   - For `Post`, ensure that the list displays `title`, `author`, and `date_created`, that you can search by `title` and `author__name`, and that there is a filter for `date_created`.
   - For `PostCategory`, ensure that the model is registered and accessible.
   - For `Comment`, ensure that the list displays `author`, `post`, and `text`, that you can search by `post__title` and `author__name`, and that there is a filter for `post`.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program that automates the process of downloading puzzle input data for the Advent of Code event. The Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers solve daily coding puzzles. Each puzzle comes with a unique input data file that participants need to download from the event's website.

Your program should meet the following requirements:

1. It should be able to download input data for a given year and day of the event.
2. The input data should be saved to a local file in a directory structure that follows the pattern `year/day/input.txt`.
3. If the input data file already exists, the program should not attempt to download it again.
4. The program should use a session cookie for authentication to download the input data.
5. The session cookie should be read from a JSON file named `.adventofcode.json` located in the current working directory. The JSON file should have a structure like `{""session"": ""your-session-cookie""}`.
6. The program should provide a command-line interface that allows the user to specify the year for which to download the input data. If the year is not specified, the current year should be used.
7. The program should attempt to download input data for all days (1 through 25) of the specified year.

Implement a function `radix_sort` that performs a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm on a list of non-negative integers. The function should sort the numbers based on their digits, starting from the least significant digit and moving towards the most significant digit. This sorting algorithm is known as Radix Sort.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:

- The input list `A` contains non-negative integers only.
- The function should handle variable-length integers within the list.
- The function should return a new list containing the sorted integers.
- The function should not use any built-in sorting functions or methods.

Create a Python game using the `turtle` module where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food items to grow in size and increase the score. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.

The game should have the following features:
- The snake is initially one segment long and grows by one segment each time it eats food.
- Food items appear randomly on the screen, and the snake must move over them to eat them.
- The snake is controlled using the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for up, left, down, and right movement, respectively.
- The game keeps track of the score, which increases by one each time the snake eats food.
- The game ends with a ""Game over!"" message if the snake hits the screen edges or itself.

Design a microservice in Python using Flask that handles the process of placing an order in an e-commerce system. The service should interact with other microservices for wallet balance checks, order creation, and escrow service for payment holding. The service should also communicate with a RabbitMQ message broker to publish messages about order status, errors, and notifications.

The microservice should expose an endpoint `/place_order` that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the order details. The order processing should include the following steps:

1. Validate the incoming JSON payload for the required order fields.
2. Check the user's wallet balance from the wallet microservice.
3. If the balance is sufficient, deduct the final price from the wallet and update the order status to ""pending"".
4. Create the order using the order microservice.
5. If the order is successfully created and pending, create an escrow record using the escrow microservice.
6. Publish appropriate messages to the RabbitMQ exchange for order status updates, notifications, and errors using different routing keys.

The microservice should handle any exceptions and errors gracefully, providing meaningful responses and publishing error messages to RabbitMQ when necessary.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can simulate the microservices and RabbitMQ broker or mock their responses and test the `/place_order` endpoint with different scenarios:

1. Test with a valid JSON payload where the user has sufficient wallet balance.
2. Test with a valid JSON payload where the user has insufficient wallet balance.
3. Test with a valid JSON payload where the order creation fails.
4. Test with a valid JSON payload where the escrow creation fails.
5. Test with an invalid JSON payload to check the error handling.

For each test case, you should check the response from the endpoint and any messages published to RabbitMQ to ensure they match the expected outcomes.",Python,McEval-Instruct

A school is holding a physical education class, and each student is supposed to wear a uniform. Unfortunately, some students have lost their uniforms, and some students have brought an extra uniform that they can lend to others. The task is to write a function that calculates the maximum number of students who can participate in the class by borrowing uniforms from those who brought extras.

The function `solution` should take three parameters:
- `n` (int): The total number of students in the class.
- `lost` (list of int): A list of the students who have lost their uniforms. The students are numbered from 1 to `n`.
- `reserve` (list of int): A list of the students who have brought an extra uniform. These students may or may not be in the `lost` list.

The function should return an integer representing the maximum number of students who can attend the class with a uniform. A student can only borrow a uniform from a student whose number is either immediately before or after their own number (i.e., student `i` can only borrow from student `i-1` or `i+1`).

","

```python
def solution(n, lost, reserve):
    # Initialize the answer with the number of students who have not lost their uniform
    answer = n - len(lost)
    
    # Normalize the lists by removing the intersection
    # Students who lost their uniform but have an extra one
    normalized_lost = set(lost) - set(reserve)
    normalized_reserve = set(reserve) - set(lost)
    
    # Iterate over the normalized list of students who lost their uniforms
    for student in sorted(normalized_lost):
        # Check if a student before or after can lend a uniform
        if student - 1 in normalized_reserve:
            normalized_reserve.remove(student - 1)
            answer += 1
        elif student + 1 in normalized_reserve:
            normalized_reserve.remove(student + 1)
            answer += 1
    
    return answer

# Test cases to verify the solution
# Case 1: No student has lost a uniform
print(solution(5, [], [1, 3, 5]))  # Expected output: 5

# Case 2: All students who lost a uniform can borrow one
print(solution(5, [2, 4], [1, 3, 5]))  # Expected output: 5

# Case 3: One student cannot borrow a uniform
print(solution(5, [2, 4], [3]))  # Expected output: 4

# Case 4: Students who lost a uniform also have an extra one
print(solution(5, [2, 3], [3, 4]))  # Expected output: 5

# Case 5: Complex case with multiple lost and reserve uniforms
print(solution(7, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]))  # Expected output: 6
```

The provided solution uses set operations to normalize the `lost` and `reserve` lists by removing the intersection, which represents students who have lost a uniform but also have an extra one. Then, it iterates over the sorted list of students who need a uniform, checking if there is a student who can lend one. The answer is incremented for each successful borrowing. The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness of the solution.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Given a 2D matrix `mat` and an integer `k`, write a function `matrixBlockSum` that computes the sum of elements in a block of size `(2k+1) x (2k+1)` centered at each element of the matrix. The block may extend beyond the borders of the matrix, but only the elements within the matrix should be considered for the sum.

The function should return a 2D matrix where each element `(i, j)` contains the sum of the block centered at `(i, j)`.

For example, given the matrix `mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` and `k = 1`, the function should return `[[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]`.

Create a Python command-line interface (CLI) application named `cliweather` that fetches and displays the current weather information for a given city. The application should be packaged and distributed using `setuptools`, allowing users to install it via `pip` and run it from the command line. The application should use asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The CLI application should meet the following requirements:

1. Accept a city name as a command-line argument.
2. Fetch the current weather data for the given city from the OpenWeatherMap API using an asynchronous HTTP request.
3. Display the weather information in a human-readable format, including temperature, weather description, and wind speed.

Write a Python program to calculate the Shannon entropy of the occurrence of digits in a randomly generated list of integers. The Shannon entropy is a measure of the unpredictability or information content in a random variable, which in this case is the frequency of each digit (0-9) in the list.

The program should include the following functions:

1. `generate_random_list(size: int, seed: int = None) -> list`: Generates a list of random integers between 0 and 9, inclusive. The `size` parameter determines the number of integers in the list. The `seed` parameter is optional and can be used to ensure reproducibility.

2. `calculate_probabilities(rand_list: list) -> list`: Calculates the probabilities of each digit occurring in the `rand_list`. It returns a list of probabilities corresponding to the digits 0-9.

3. `calculate_shannon_entropy(probabilities: list) -> float`: Calculates the Shannon entropy based on the list of probabilities provided. It returns the entropy value.

4. `plot_entropy_vs_size(sizes: list, entropies: list)`: Plots the Shannon entropy against the size of the random list. The `sizes` parameter is a list of sizes of the random lists, and `entropies` is a list of corresponding entropy values.

The program should take two images as input: a source image and a destination image. It should detect facial landmarks in both images, compute the Delaunay triangulation for the average shape of the two sets of landmarks, and then morph the source image towards the destination image by blending the corresponding triangles. The morphing should be controlled by an alpha parameter that determines the blend ratio (0 means the source image, 1 means the destination image, and 0.5 is an equal blend of both).

The program should be able to:
- Load two images specified by the user.

Write a Python program that automates the creation of various types of documents with unique timestamps. The program should create a new directory with subdirectories for each document type (PDF, TXT, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word). Each subdirectory should contain a specified number of files of its respective type, each with a unique name that includes a timestamp and an index number.

The program should follow these requirements:

1. Create a new directory named with the current timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` on the user's Desktop within a folder named `WF`. If the directory already exists, it should notify the user without creating a new one.
2. Inside the new directory, create subdirectories for each document type: `ppt`, `pdf`, `txt`, `docs`, and `excel`.
3. Generate a specified number of files for each document type, with names that include the document type, a unique timestamp, and an index number (e.g., `pdf_doc_number20230315-1030001.pdf`).
4. The content of each file should be a simple placeholder text or value that includes the document type and index number.

The program should include the following functions:
- `create_pdf(path)`: Creates PDF files in the `pdf` subdirectory.
- `create_txt(path)`: Creates text files in the `txt` subdirectory.
- `create_excel(path)`: Creates Excel files in the `excel` subdirectory.
- `create_presentation(path)`: Creates PowerPoint files in the `ppt` subdirectory.
- `create_document(path)`: Creates Word documents in the `docs` subdirectory.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python function `create_email_log_entry` that creates a new entry in an email log database table. The function should take parameters for the recipient's email, recipient's name, email subject, and status code of the email sending operation. It should use the Django ORM to interact with the database.

The function should also ensure that the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are automatically set to the current date and time when the entry is created, and the `updated_at` field should be updated to the current date and time whenever the entry is modified.

Implement a class `GPP` (Generalized Pyramid Pooling) that performs different types of pyramid pooling on a batch of 2D feature maps with optional masking. The class should support three types of pyramid pooling: Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP), Temporal Pyramid Pooling (TPP), and Generic Pyramid Pooling (GPP). The class should be able to handle feature maps of varying sizes by using adaptive pooling to produce fixed-size outputs.

The `GPP` class should have the following characteristics:
- It should inherit from `torch.nn.Module`.
- The constructor should accept the following parameters:
  - `gpp_type`: a string indicating the type of pyramid pooling to perform. It can be `'spp'`, `'tpp'`, or `'gpp'`.
  - `levels`: an integer for SPP and TPP, or a tuple of two lists for GPP, indicating the pyramid levels.
  - `pool_type`: a string indicating the type of pooling operation to use. It can be `'max_pool'` or `'avg_pool'`.
- The class should raise a `ValueError` if an unknown `gpp_type` or `pool_type` is provided.
- The `forward` method should accept a batch of 2D feature maps and an optional mask, and return the pooled feature maps.
- The class should include private methods `_spatial_pyramid_pooling`, `_temporal_pyramid_pooling`, and `_generic_pyramid_pooling` to handle the different pooling strategies.

Implement a class `MyQueue` that simulates a basic queue with the following operations:

1. `enqueue(elem: Any) -> None`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. `dequeue() -> Any`: Removes and returns the element from the beginning of the queue. If the queue is empty, it should return `None`.
3. `peek(ind: int = 0) -> Any`: Returns the element at the specified position in the queue without removing it. If the index is out of bounds, it should return `None`. The index `0` corresponds to the first element.
4. `clear() -> None`: Removes all elements from the queue.
5. `size() -> int`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

The `MyQueue` class should use a list to store the elements. The `enqueue` operation should insert elements at the beginning of the list, and the `dequeue` operation should remove elements from the end of the list to maintain the queue's FIFO (first-in, first-out) behavior.

Design a simple chat client that connects to a chat server using sockets. The client should be able to send and receive messages in real-time. The client will prompt the user for a nickname, which will be used to identify the user in the chat. The server expects the client to send this nickname immediately after connecting. If the server sends the message ""NICK"", the client should respond with its nickname.

The client should have two main functionalities: receiving messages and sending messages. These functionalities should be handled in separate threads to allow for simultaneous sending and receiving.

The client should handle the following scenarios:
1. Receiving a message from the server and displaying it to the user.
2. Sending a message entered by the user to the server.
3. Gracefully handling the disconnection from the server, either by the server's action or by the user entering ""Disconnect"".

The client should also handle any exceptions that occur during communication, such as the server closing the connection, and inform the user of the error before closing the client.

**Test Cases**:

Since this code snippet is designed to connect to a chat server, the test cases would involve interaction with a live server. Therefore, to test the solution, you would need to have a chat server running on the same IP and port specified in the code. The server should be able to handle multiple client connections, receive messages from clients, and broadcast them to all connected clients.

1. Start the chat server and run the client code. Choose a nickname and ensure the server acknowledges the nickname.
2. Send a message from the client and verify that it is received by the server and broadcasted to other clients.
3. Connect multiple clients and ensure they can all send and receive messages in real-time.
4. Type ""Disconnect"" in one of the clients and ensure that the client disconnects gracefully and the server handles the disconnection without crashing.
5. Simulate a server crash or disconnection and ensure the client handles the error and closes the connection with an appropriate message.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python script that changes the permissions of directories and files within a specified root directory. The script should be able to:

1. Change the permissions of all directories to `755` (readable, writable, and executable by the owner; readable and executable by the group and others).
2. Change the permissions of all files to `666` (readable and writable by everyone).

The script should take the root directory as an argument and apply the permission changes recursively to all subdirectories and files within it. The script should also handle any potential errors, such as insufficient permissions or a non-existent directory, and print a user-friendly message.

Additionally, the script should print a confirmation message once the permissions have been successfully changed for all directories and files.

Implement a Python class `ClassifierFreeSampleModel` that serves as a wrapper for a neural network model to perform classifier-free guidance sampling. The class should inherit from `torch.nn.Module` and wrap around an existing model that has been trained with a conditional mask probability greater than zero. The class should support different modes of conditioning, such as 'text' and 'action'.

The `ClassifierFreeSampleModel` should implement four different forward methods:
1. `forward`: This method should perform classifier-free guidance by combining the outputs of the conditioned and unconditioned models, with a scaling factor applied to the difference between the two outputs. The scaling factor should be provided in the `y` dictionary under the key 'scale'.
2. `forward_smd_final`: This method should perform a similar operation to `forward`, but with a fixed scaling factor of 1.5.
3. `forward_correct`: This method should mask out spatial features from the input `x` and perform classifier-free guidance with a fixed scaling factor of 1.8.
4. `forward_average`: This method should combine the outputs of the spatially conditioned and text-conditioned models, with a scaling factor applied to the difference between the two outputs. The scaling factor should be provided in the `y` dictionary under the key 'scale', and the method should also use a fixed ratio `kps_to_text_ratio` of 1.5 to weigh the contribution of the spatially conditioned output.

The class should include assertions to ensure that the model has been trained with a conditional mask probability and that the `cond_mode` is either 'text' or 'action'. Additionally, the class should handle the case where the input `y` dictionary does not contain the 'uncond' key by creating a deep copy of `y` and setting `y_uncond['uncond']` to `True`.

Implement a class `PatternMatcher` that contains a method `isMatch` which checks if a given string `s` matches with the pattern `p`. The pattern string `p` can include the characters `?` and `*` where:
- `?` Matches any single character.
- `*` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

**Note**:
- The method should have a time complexity of O(min(s,p)) and a space complexity of O(1).
- The input strings only contain lowercase English letters and the special characters `?` and `*`.

Create a Python class `LaTeXDocument` that provides a high-level interface for generating LaTeX documents programmatically. The class should allow users to add various elements to the document, such as sections, subsections, paragraphs, bullet points, equations, images, and tables. It should also support setting document metadata like title, author, and date, and include functionality to compile the LaTeX document into a PDF.

The class should use context managers to handle the beginning and ending of environments (e.g., sections, itemize lists, etc.) to ensure proper structure and indentation in the generated LaTeX code. Additionally, the class should provide methods to include LaTeX packages, set the bibliography style, and manage graphics paths.

Implement the `LaTeXDocument` class with the following methods:
- `__init__(self, filename, documentclass='article', options=None)`: Initialize a new LaTeX document with the given filename, document class, and class options.
- `add_section(self, title, label=None)`: Add a section with the given title and an optional label for referencing.
- `add_subsection(self, title, label=None)`: Add a subsection with the given title and an optional label for referencing.
- `add_paragraph(self, text)`: Add a paragraph with the given text.
- `add_bullet_points(self, items)`: Add a bullet point list with the given items.
- `add_equation(self, equation, label=None)`: Add an equation with the given LaTeX code and an optional label for referencing.
- `add_image(self, filepath, options=None)`: Add an image with the given file path and optional LaTeX options for formatting.
- `add_table(self, data, column_format, caption=None, label=None)`: Add a table with the given data, column format, caption, and an optional label for referencing.
- `set_metadata(self, title=None, author=None, date=None)`: Set the document's metadata.
- `compile(self)`: Compile the LaTeX document into a PDF.

The class should handle the proper escaping of LaTeX special characters in text inputs and ensure that the generated LaTeX code is correctly indented and formatted.

Write a Python function named `apply_ragged_boolean_mask` that applies a boolean mask to a given ragged tensor data structure using TensorFlow's `tf.ragged.boolean_mask` function. A ragged tensor is a tensor with variable numbers of elements along some axis. The function should handle exceptions gracefully and return either the masked ragged tensor or an appropriate error message.

The function should accept two parameters:
1. `data`: A list of lists of integers representing the ragged tensor data.
2. `mask`: A list of booleans with the same outer dimension as `data`, indicating which rows to keep.

The function should perform the following steps:
- Convert the `data` list of lists into a `tf.RaggedTensor`.
- Apply the boolean mask to the ragged tensor using `tf.ragged.boolean_mask`.
- Return the resulting masked ragged tensor as a list of lists.

If an exception occurs during the process (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions between `data` and `mask`), the function should catch the exception and return a string with the error message and the line number where the exception occurred.

Design a Python class `AsyncRavenClient` that extends the functionality of the `raven.base.Client` class to send error messages asynchronously using Tornado's asynchronous I/O loop. The class should be able to handle sending messages, and callbacks for successful and failed sends. The class should also be able to be tested using Tornado's testing framework.

The `AsyncRavenClient` class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(dsn, timeout, verify_ssl, ca_certs)`: Initializes the client with the given DSN (Data Source Name), timeout for connections, SSL verification flag, and path to CA certificates.
- `captureMessage(message)`: Asynchronously sends a message to the configured DSN.
- `_successful_send()`: A callback method that is called when a message is sent successfully.
- `_failed_send()`: A callback method that is called when a message fails to be sent.

Write unit tests for the `AsyncRavenClient` class to ensure that:
- An instance of `httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient` is created.
- The `captureMessage` method sends a message with the correct parameters.
- The `_successful_send` callback is called when a message is sent successfully.

This solution defines the `AsyncRavenClient` class with the required methods and includes unit tests to verify the functionality of sending messages and handling callbacks. The tests use Tornado's `AsyncTestCase` and `gen_test` decorator to run asynchronous code. Mocking is used to simulate the behavior of the `AsyncHTTPClient` and to check that the correct callbacks are called.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Django application that serves a blog website with the following requirements:

1. The homepage (`blog_index.html`) should list all published blog posts sorted by their creation date in descending order. A blog post is considered published if its `status` is set to `1`.

2. Each blog post should be accessible through a detail page (`post_detail.html`), where the full content of the post can be read.

3. The `Post` model has the following fields:
    - `title`: A string representing the title of the post.
    - `content`: A text field containing the full content of the post.
    - `created_on`: A datetime field representing when the post was created.
    - `status`: An integer field where `1` indicates the post is published and `0` indicates it is a draft.

4. Implement the views using Django's class-based views to handle the listing and detail display of blog posts.

5. Write a docstring for each class-based view describing its purpose and functionality.

6. Provide test cases to verify that the views are correctly retrieving and displaying the blog posts.

In this solution, we have defined two class-based views, `PostList` and `PostDetail`, which inherit from Django's generic views `ListView` and `DetailView`, respectively. The `PostList` view is used to display a list of published blog posts, while the `PostDetail` view is used to display the full content of a specific blog post. We have also provided test cases to ensure that the views are functioning as expected.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Python program that acts as a simplified voice-activated Wikipedia search assistant. The program should be able to listen for a specific trigger word (""Wikipedia"") and then prompt the user to input a search term. After receiving the search term, the program should fetch a summary of the topic from Wikipedia and output the first three sentences of the article. The program should handle inputs and outputs through a simulated microphone and text interface, as the actual voice recognition and text-to-speech functionalities are not implemented.

The program should include a function `handle` that takes in a search term, fetches the Wikipedia summary, and outputs the result. It should also include a function `isValid` that checks if the input text contains the trigger word ""Wikipedia"". For the purpose of this question, assume that the `TCPclient` module provides two functions: `grab_input` to simulate receiving input from the user and `send_out` to simulate sending output to the user.

The program should handle cases where the user inputs ""Wikipedia"" as the search term by prompting them to enter a different term. It should also handle any exceptions that may occur when fetching data from Wikipedia, such as when the search term does not correspond to any Wikipedia page.

The I Ching, also known as the Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text and among the oldest of the Chinese classics. The following Python program simulates the process of I Ching divination using the method of three coins, where each coin has a value of 2 (heads) or 3 (tails). The sum of the three coins determines the nature of the line (yin or yang, young or old) in a hexagram. A hexagram is a stack of six lines, each of which is either broken (yin) or unbroken (yang).

The program also includes a CSV file named ""ichingdict.csv"" that maps the binary representation of a hexagram (0 for yin, 1 for yang) to its corresponding name, number, and description. The CSV file has the following format:

```
binary_representation,hexagram_number,hexagram_name,hexagram_description
```

For example:

```
111111,1,Ch'ien,The Creative
000000,2,K'un,The Receptive
...
```

The task is to complete the Python program that:
1. Simulates the casting of three coins six times to create a hexagram.
2. Reads the ""ichingdict.csv"" file to create a dictionary that maps the binary representation of a hexagram to its details.
3. Prints out the hexagram's number, name, and description.
4. Asks the user if they would like to open a webpage with more information about the drawn hexagram. If the user inputs 'y', the program should open the corresponding URL. If the user inputs 'n', the program should end. For any other input, the program should print an error message and end.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to run the program multiple times as the coin tosses are random. Each time, the program should print out the lines of the hexagram, the hexagram's number, name, and description, and then ask the user if they would like to open the webpage. The user's response should be handled as described in the task. Since the coin tosses are random, the test cases would be the different possible outcomes of the divination and user responses.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program that validates the uniqueness of identifiers in a L20n Localization (.lol) file. L20n is a localization framework designed to improve upon the existing localization solutions. A `.lol` file contains entities and macros that should have unique identifiers.

Your task is to create a function `validate_lol_file` that takes the path to a `.lol` file as input and checks for the following:
- The file should be correctly parsed as a L20n file.
- All entities and macros should have unique identifiers.

The function should return a tuple containing two lists: the first list should contain any parsing errors, and the second list should contain warnings about duplicated identifiers.

If the file cannot be parsed, the function should return a list with a single error message and an empty list for warnings. If there are duplicated identifiers, the function should return an empty list for errors and a list of warnings with messages indicating the duplicated identifiers.

You should use the given code snippet as a starting point and improve upon it to create a robust solution. Make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases appropriately.

Design a Python application that allows users to manage planting data for an agricultural application.

The application should support importing data from various file formats, including text files (.csv, .txt), ISO XML files (.xml+.bin), shapefiles (.shp), and georeferenced rasters (.tif, .geotif). Additionally, the application should allow manual data entry and save the data to a database.

Implement the `SavePlanting` class, which provides the functionality to import data from different file types and save manual planting data to a database.

Write a Python program that generates and visualizes the time-domain signal and its frequency spectrum for different types of digital modulation schemes. The program should support Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation types.

The program should take the following command-line arguments:
1. `file`: The filename to save the plot image (default: 'signal_plot.png').
2. `TYPE`: The type of modulation ('fsk', 'psk', or 'ask').
3. `freq`: The base frequency for the signal (default: 10 Hz).

The program should create a time-domain signal based on the specified modulation type and a corresponding frequency spectrum using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The time-domain signal and its frequency spectrum should be plotted in two subplots.

The bit patterns for the modulation schemes are as follows:
- FSK: `[5, 5, -5, 5, -5]` representing high and low frequencies.
- PSK: `[180, 180, 0, 180, 0]` representing phase shifts in degrees.
- ASK: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]` representing on and off amplitudes.

The sampling rate `Fs` is set to 150 Hz, and the signal duration is 2 seconds.

Write a function `maxProduct` that finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. The subarray must contain at least one number and does not need to include the entire array.

The function should be a part of the `Solution` class and should take a list of integers as input and return an integer representing the maximum product of a contiguous subarray.

For example:
- Given the array `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function should return `6`, as the subarray `[2, 3]` has the maximum product.
- Given the array `[-2, 0, -1]`, the function should return `0`, as the subarray `[0]` has the maximum product.

Write a Python script using the Luigi library to create a data pipeline for ingesting EO (Electro-Optical) and IR (Infrared) images into a database. The script should include three separate Luigi tasks for processing images from different surveys: CHESS_us, Beaufort_19, and CHESS_ru. Each task should read images from a specified directory, parse the filenames to extract metadata, and insert records into the database using SQLAlchemy ORM. The database schema includes EOImage and IRImage models, which should be populated with the image metadata.

The script should also handle the creation of necessary database tables and provide a cleanup mechanism to remove records associated with a specific camera from the database.

The EOImage and IRImage models should have the following fields:
- event_key: a unique identifier for the image event
- filename: the name of the image file
- directory: the directory where the image file is located
- width: the width of the image in pixels
- height: the height of the image in pixels
- depth: the color depth of the image
- timestamp: the timestamp when the image was taken
- camera: a reference to the camera that took the image

The filename parsing functions `parse_chess_fn` and `parse_beaufort_filename` should extract the flight, camera, and timestamp information from the filenames, which follow specific naming conventions for each survey.

The script should include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution, using mock data for the image files and a test database.

In a 3D space, a reactor is represented by a cubic grid. Each cube (cell) in the grid can be either on or off. A series of reboot steps are used to turn cubes on or off within a specified range in the 3D space. The ranges are inclusive and the grid is initially entirely off.

The reactor grid is a 101x101x101 grid, where the coordinates (x, y, z) range from -50 to 50 in all three dimensions.

The reboot steps are provided in a file with each line describing a step in the following format:
```
on x=10..12,y=10..12,z=10..12
off x=9..11,y=9..11,z=9..11
```
The first word is either ""on"" or ""off"", indicating whether to turn the cubes in the range on or off. The ranges for x, y, and z coordinates follow, with two integers specifying the start and end of the range, inclusive.

Your task is to write a program that reads the reboot steps from a file, applies them to the reactor grid, and then counts the number of cubes that are on.

Create a class `WASDController` that simulates the movement and camera control for a 3D application using the WASD keyboard scheme and mouse movement. The class should handle the position and orientation of the camera in a 3D scene, allowing the user to move forward/backward with W/S keys, strafe left/right with A/D keys, and look around with mouse movement.

The class should include the following features:
- Initialize the controller with a given speed, mouse sensitivity, and options to invert the Y-axis and to lock the mouse exclusively for camera control.
- Update the camera's position and orientation based on keyboard inputs and mouse movement.
- Provide methods to get the current position, view direction vector, and a transformation matrix representing the camera's position and orientation in the scene.
- Handle mouse button events to toggle exclusive mouse control.
- Handle keyboard events to exit exclusive mouse control with the ESC key.

The class should be compatible with a hypothetical 3D graphics library, represented by the placeholder classes `Scene`, `Matrix`, and `glfw` (a stand-in for a library like GLFW).

Create a Python function that estimates the fare for a taxi ride in New York City using a machine learning model. The fare is predicted based on the year, hour of the day, distance of the trip, and the number of passengers. The function should also calculate the distance between two geographical points given their latitude and longitude coordinates.

The machine learning model has already been trained and saved as a pickle file. The function should load this model and use it to make predictions. Additionally, the function should handle HTTP requests to receive ride details and respond with the estimated fare.

Implement the following functionalities:

1. A function `predict_fare(year, hour, distance, passenger_count)` that uses a pre-trained linear regression model to predict the fare.
2. A function `distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)` that calculates the distance between two points on the Earth given their latitude and longitude.
3. A Django view `index(request)` that handles AJAX POST requests with ride details and returns a JSON response with the estimated fare. If the request is not an AJAX POST request, it should return an HTTP 400 Bad Request response or render the ""index.html"" template.

Write a function `find_accumulator_before_loop` that reads a file containing a simple set of instructions for a boot code and returns the value of the accumulator right before any instruction is executed a second time, which would indicate the start of an infinite loop.

The boot code is represented in a text file where each line contains an instruction consisting of an operation (`op`) and an argument (`arg`). The possible operations are:

- `acc` increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given in the argument. For example, `acc +7` would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at 0.
- `jmp` jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an offset from the `jmp` instruction; for example, `jmp +2` would skip the next instruction, `jmp +1` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and `jmp -20` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.
- `nop` stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.

The function should take the filename of the boot code as its argument and return the value of the accumulator.

The class should use the provided `DenseNetEncoder` and `ResNetEncoder` classes to perform the feature extraction. The `extract_features` method should return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the feature sets (e.g., `'s0'`, `'s1'`, etc. for DenseNet, and `'s0'`, `'s3'`, `'s4'`, etc. for ResNet) and the values are the corresponding feature tensors.

Maria plays basketball and keeps track of the points she scores in each game throughout the season. She wants to know how many times during the season she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Write a function `breakingRecords(scores)` where `scores` is a list of integers representing the points Maria scores in each game. The function should return a list of two integers: the first integer should indicate how many times Maria breaks her record for most points in a game over the season, and the second should indicate how many times she breaks her record for least points in a game over the season.

In a multiplayer game, we have a system that spawns enemies in the game world. The enemies are spawned by a `DistributedEnemySpawner` object, which is a distributed object that can be synchronized across the network. The `DistributedEnemySpawner` is responsible for creating enemies at random locations within the game world at random intervals.

Your task is to extend the given `DistributedEnemySpawner` class to include the functionality of spawning enemies at random intervals. The enemies should be spawned with a unique identifier and a random location (x, y coordinates). The spawner should also keep track of all spawned enemies.

Implement the following features in the `DistributedEnemySpawner` class:

1. A method `spawnEnemy` that creates an enemy with a unique identifier and random x, y coordinates. The method should print a message in the format: ""Spawned enemy with ID: {id} at location: ({x}, {y})"".
2. A method `startSpawning` that starts the enemy spawning process. It should spawn enemies at random intervals between 1 to 5 seconds.
3. A method `stopSpawning` that stops the enemy spawning process.
4. A list attribute `spawnedEnemies` that keeps track of all the spawned enemies' identifiers.

For simplicity, assume that the `DistributedObject` class and its methods are already implemented and working correctly. You do not need to implement any network synchronization code.

**Note**: Use the `random` module to generate random IDs and locations, and the `time` module to handle the timing of enemy spawns.

Write a Python class `TrainingRecord` that represents a training record with the following attributes: `student`, `group`, `date`, `instructor1`, `instructor2`, `instructor3`, `exercise`, `time`, `grade`, `examiner`, `type`, `time_hours`, `time_mins`, `instrumental_time_hours`, `instrumental_time_mins`, `quantity_approach`, `quantity_landing`, `extra_time_hours`, `extra_time_mins`, `captain_hours`, `captain_mins`, `captain_route_hours`, `captain_route_mins`, `captain_night_hours`, `captain_night_mins`, `times_of_day`, `flight_permit`, `meteo_height`, `meteo_vis`, `meteo_wind`, `characteristic`, `remarks`, and `deletion_mark`.

Additionally, implement a method `update_record` within the `TrainingRecord` class that takes a `request` object and a `chapter` number as parameters.

Create a Django web application that allows users to manage their medication schedule. The application should have the following features:

1. A home page that welcomes the user and provides navigation to other parts of the application.
2. An 'Add Medication' page where users can add new medication schedules. Each schedule should include the name of the medicine, the start time, and the duration for which the medicine should be taken.
3. A 'View Schedule' page where users can view all their scheduled medications.
4. The application should use Django's authentication system to associate medication schedules with the logged-in user.

The `Userschedule` model has the following fields:
- `item`: A string representing the name of the medicine.
- `time`: A `DateTimeField` representing the start time for taking the medicine.
- `duration`: An integer representing the number of days the medicine should be taken.
- `userref`: A foreign key to Django's `User` model, representing the user who scheduled the medication.

Write the Django views for the 'Add Medication' and 'View Schedule' pages, ensuring that only authenticated users can add or view their schedules. Use the given code snippet as a starting point and expand upon it to create a complete solution.

    data = Userschedule.objects.filter(userref=request.user)
    return render(request, ""show.html"", {'data': data})

# Test cases to verify the solution correctness
# Note: These test cases would typically be run in a Django testing environment.

# Test case 1: Add a new medication schedule
# This would simulate a POST request to the 'add' view with medication details.
# The test would verify that a new Userschedule object is created and associated with the logged-in user.

# Test case 2: View medication schedules
# This would simulate a GET request to the 'show' view.
# The test would verify that the correct schedules are retrieved and displayed for the logged-in user.
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the `Userschedule` model and the necessary HTML templates (`home.html`, `add.html`, and `show.html`) are already created. The `timezone.now()` function is used to set the current time for the medication start time, which may not be the desired behavior in a real-world application. In practice, you would likely have a form with a date picker to allow the user to select the start time. Additionally, the test cases are described in comments, as actual test cases would require a Django testing framework setup which is beyond the scope of this example.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `clip_geodataframes` that clips the geometries in a GeoDataFrame of traces by the geometries in a GeoDataFrame of areas. The function should handle different geometry types, including MultiPolygon and MultiLineString, and should allow for optional arguments to keep the original geometry type and to strip the coordinate reference system (CRS) from the input GeoDataFrames.

The function should return a new GeoDataFrame containing the clipped geometries. If the `keep_geom_type` argument is `True`, the output geometries should be of the same type as the input trace geometries. If `strip_crs` is `True`, the function should remove the CRS from both the traces and areas GeoDataFrames before clipping.

Additionally, write test cases using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the `clip_geodataframes` function. The test cases should cover different combinations of input geometries and the optional arguments.

In the game of Quixo, players take turns sliding pieces on a 5x5 board to form a line of their own tokens. The given code snippet represents a simplified version of Quixo where a player (O) competes against an opponent (X). The player's moves are determined by an AI using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, while the opponent's moves are input by the user.

Write a Python program that simulates a game of Quixo between an AI player and a human opponent. The AI should use the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to determine its moves, and the human opponent should input their moves via the console. The game ends when one player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their tokens, or when all pieces on the board are filled and no line is formed.

The program should include the following functionalities:
- Initialize a 5x5 Quixo board with numbered pieces that can be moved by players.
- Allow the AI to make a move by sliding a piece from the edge of the board to an empty space or a space containing one of its tokens.
- Allow the human opponent to input their move by specifying the piece to move and the target position.
- Check for a winning condition after each move.
- Display the board after each move.
- Handle invalid moves and provide appropriate error messages.
- Determine the game's outcome and announce the winner or a draw.

Design a Python class `CustomModule` that inherits from a base class `BaseModule` and implements a simple lifecycle for a module in a software system. The lifecycle consists of three stages: initialization, start, and stop. Each stage should log a message indicating the current action being performed by the module. The base class `BaseModule` is not provided, so you will need to create it as well.

The `CustomModule` class should override three methods from the `BaseModule` class: `_execute_initialization`, `_execute_start`, and `_execute_stop`. Each method should first call its superclass implementation and then log a message specific to the `CustomModule`. Additionally, the `CustomModule` should have a `load` method that returns `True` to indicate successful loading.

The logging should be done using Python's built-in `logging` module. Ensure that the logger is properly configured to display debug messages.

Provide test cases to verify that the `CustomModule` correctly logs messages during each stage of the lifecycle.

Write a Python program to calculate the determinant of a circular adjacency matrix representing a simple undirected cycle graph with `n` vertices, where `n` is a positive integer provided by the user. A simple undirected cycle graph is a graph that forms a single cycle, meaning that each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, except for the first and last vertices, which are also connected to each other, forming a cycle.

The adjacency matrix for a cycle graph is a square matrix `A` of size `n x n` where the entry `A[i][j]` is `1` if the vertices `i` and `j` are connected by an edge and `0` otherwise. For the purpose of this problem, modify the adjacency matrix to a circular adjacency matrix by setting the diagonal entries to `3` and the entries corresponding to edges to `-1`. The matrix should be constructed as follows:

- `A[i][i] = 3` for all `0 <= i < n`
- `A[i][i+1] = A[i+1][i] = -1` for all `0 <= i < n-1`
- Additionally, `A[0][n-1] = A[n-1][0] = -1` to complete the cycle.

Your task is to calculate the determinant of this circular adjacency matrix using Gaussian elimination without pivoting. The determinant should be printed as an integer without any decimal places.

Write a Python program that scrapes airfield data from a specified URL and processes the information into a structured JSON format. The program should perform the following tasks:

1. Scrape airfield and runway data from the given URL, which contains an HTML table with airfield information.
2. Parse the HTML content to extract airfield and runway details, such as code, name, magnetic orientation, geographic coordinates, altitude, traffic, ground level, status, runway details, surface type, orientation, threshold positions, and altitudes.
3. Clean and transform the data into a more usable format, including:
   - Title-casing airfield names.
   - Capitalizing status fields.
   - Converting altitude, magnetic orientation, and ground level to appropriate numeric types.
   - Splitting geographic coordinates, runway orientations, and positions into separate components.
   - Parsing and separating runway surface details into length, width, and surface type.
4. Save the processed data into a JSON file with a structured format, where each airfield is an object with its details and an array of runways, each with its own details.

The program should handle any missing or incomplete data gracefully by setting the corresponding fields to `None`.

Write a Python class `IntervalMerger` that contains a method `merge_intervals`. This method takes a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple `(start, end)`, and returns a list of merged intervals. Two intervals `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are considered overlapping if `b >= c`. The merged interval of overlapping intervals is the interval `(min(a, c), max(b, d))`.

The input list of intervals may not be sorted, and the output list should have the merged intervals sorted by their start times. If no intervals overlap, the output should be the same as the input, except sorted.

The class should also contain an inner class `Interval` to represent an interval with a start and an end.

### Guidelines:
- Define the `Interval` class with an appropriate constructor.
- Implement the `merge_intervals` method to merge the overlapping intervals.
- Ensure that the code handles edge cases, such as an empty list of intervals.
- Include docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of both the `Interval` and `IntervalMerger` classes.
- Provide test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python class `BasicSentenceBatchEncoder` that inherits from a base class `SentenceBatchEncoder`. The `BasicSentenceBatchEncoder` class is intended to be used for encoding sentences for machine translation tasks. The class should have the following functionalities:

1. A method `_fit` that takes a dataset object of type `WSDMTDataset` and performs any necessary fitting operations on the dataset. The dataset type `WSDMTDataset` is not defined within the scope of this question, so the `_fit` method should simply pass without any implementation.

2. A method `encode_sentences` that takes a list of source sentences (`src_sentences`) and an optional list of target sentences (`tgt_sentences`). It should encode the sentences using a tokenizer that supports language-specific tokenization. The tokenizer is assumed to be an attribute of the class and should have a method `prepare_seq2seq_batch` which takes the source and target sentences, source and target language codes, and returns a batch of tensors ready for a sequence-to-sequence model. The language codes are assumed to be the first two characters of the `langs` attribute of the class, and the tokenizer is assumed to have an attribute `lang_code_to_id` that maps language codes to IDs.

3. A method `encode` that takes a list of items of type `WSDMTParallelItem`. Each item contains a sentence ID (`sid`), a source sentence (`src_item.sentence`), and a target sentence (`tgt_item.sentence`). The method should encode the sentences using the `encode_sentences` method and return a batch with the encoded sentences and the sentence IDs.

4. A method `decode_ids` that takes a list or a `torch.Tensor` of token IDs and decodes it into a string. The method should assert that the input IDs form a one-dimensional tensor, decode the IDs using the tokenizer's `decode` method, and perform any necessary post-processing such as replacing special tokens and stripping extra spaces.

Design a system that securely handles different types of data (strings, decimals, dates, and date-times) by encrypting the values before storing them and decrypting them when authorized access is requested. The system should be able to handle cases where data is imported from external sources and ensure that it is protected upon retrieval.

Implement a set of classes that represent secure versions of basic data types: `SecureString`, `SecureDecimal`, `SecureDate`, `SecureDateTime`, and `SecureIncompleteDate`. Each secure type should inherit from a common base class `Secure`, which in turn inherits from the corresponding basic data type class (`String`, `Decimal`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `IncompleteDate`).

The `Secure` class should provide the following functionalities:
- Encrypt the value upon initialization if it is not already encrypted, requiring an encryption level to be specified.
- Decrypt the value when `get_value` is called, only if the user has the appropriate access level.
- Handle values read from external sources by unprotecting and encrypting them as needed.

The subclasses should implement a method `get_typed_value` that converts the decrypted string value back into the appropriate data type.

Create a custom Django model field `PhoneField` that inherits from `CharField` and is used to store phone numbers. The `PhoneField` should have the following characteristics:

1. It should have a maximum length of 30 characters.
2. It should use a custom validator `validate_phone` that ensures the phone number is in a valid format.
3. The description of the field should be ""Phone number in international format"".
4. The field should be represented as a string in the format `+<CountryCode> <Number>`, for example, `+1 1234567890`.

Write a Django model `Contact` that uses the `PhoneField` to store a phone number. Also, provide a custom validator `validate_phone` that checks if the phone number starts with a '+' followed by the country code and then the phone number, all separated by spaces.

Create a Python function `get_project_locales` that uses the Phrase API to retrieve a list of locales for a given project. The function should take two parameters: `api_client` (an instance of `ApiClient`) and `project_id` (a string representing the unique identifier of the project). The function should return a list of `Locale` objects representing the locales available in the specified project.

The `Locale` object should have at least the following attributes:
- `id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the locale.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the locale.
- `code`: A string representing the language code of the locale.

If the project does not exist or the API call fails, the function should raise an appropriate exception.

Given a nested list of integers, implement a function `depthSum` that returns the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth. Each element is either an integer or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the list `[1,[4,[6]]]` has its elements with the following depths:
- `1` is at depth `1`
- `4` is at depth `2`
- `6` is at depth `3`

The function should use the provided `NestedInteger` interface to access the data structure. The `NestedInteger` interface has the following methods:
- `isInteger()`: Return True if this NestedInteger holds a single integer, rather than a nested list.
- `getInteger()`: Return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a single integer. Return None if this NestedInteger holds a nested list.
- `getList()`: Return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a nested list. Return None if this NestedInteger holds a single integer.

Create a Python program that generates probability density function (PDF) plots for daily climate variables across different regions and seasons, comparing two climate scenarios or models. The program should be able to handle different global warming levels (GWLs) and specify whether the data is post-2070 for a particular GWL. The program should also save the generated plots to a specified directory.

The climate variables include temperature, skin temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and soil moisture. The regions are predefined groups of areas like boreal, euusarc, and afrea. The seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

The program should:
- Import necessary packages for data handling and visualization.
- Define the models, scenarios, GWLs, and variables to be used.
- Load the data for the specified variables and scenarios using the `getGWLdata` function.
- Group the data by season using the `groupManybySeason` function.
- Calculate the PDF for each variable, region, and season, and plot them on separate subplots within a figure.
- Distinguish between the scenarios with different line styles and include a legend.

You are tasked with creating a script that organizes MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) records based on whether they have an associated EAD (Encoded Archival Description) file and a call number. The script should categorize the MARC records into three directories: one for records with an EAD link, one for records with a call number but no EAD link, and one for records with neither an EAD link nor a call number.

The MARC records are XML files that may contain an EAD link in a `datafield` with tag `856` and a subfield with code `u`. They may also contain a call number in a `datafield` with tag `852` and a subfield with code `h`. The EAD files are also XML files, with a `unitid` element under `archdesc/did` that corresponds to the call number, and an `eadid` element that contains a collection ID.

Write a Python script that:
1. Parses the EAD files to create a list of call numbers and collection IDs.
2. Parses the MARC records and checks for the presence of an EAD link or a call number.
3. Copies the MARC records into the appropriate directory based on the presence of an EAD link or a call number.

The script should be robust, handle namespaces in XML, and use regular expressions to extract collection IDs from call numbers when necessary.

In the field of computational chemistry, researchers often use machine learning models to predict the binding energy of molecular structures based on their features. The given code snippet is part of a program that uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor to predict the average binding energy (B.E.) of a molecule based on its structural features and pair distances.

Your task is to write a Python program that performs the following steps:

1. Read in the structural features and pair distances from an Excel file named ""Octahedral_Cage_Dataset.xlsx"". The file contains three sheets: ""KDE on FG_pair_distance"" for pair distances, ""Structural Features"" for structural features, and ""Propanolol B.E."" for the binding energy data and its standard deviation (STDEV).

2. Filter out the data points where the standard deviation of the binding energy is not between 0 and 8.0.

3. Combine the structural features and pair distances into a single feature set for each data point.

4. Split the data into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) based on a simple modulo operation on the index.

5. Train an MLPRegressor with the following parameters: solver=""lbfgs"", alpha=1e-5, hidden_layer_sizes=(6), random_state=1, and max_iter=20000.

6. Predict the binding energy for the test set and calculate the R^2 score for the training set.

Design a Django application that manages polygon information. The application should provide a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

1. `GET /polygone/polygoneinfo/<int:pk>`: Retrieve the details of a polygon with a specific primary key (pk). The details should include the number of sides, the type of polygon (e.g., triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, etc.), and the lengths of the sides.

2. `GET /polygone/polygoneinfo/`: List all polygons stored in the database, including their primary keys, number of sides, and types.

3. `POST /polygone/polygonecreate/`: Create a new polygon record in the database. The request body should include the number of sides and the lengths of the sides. The type of the polygon should be determined based on the number of sides.

The solution should include the Django views that handle these requests, the URL configuration, and a simple model to store the polygon data. Additionally, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the API endpoints.

Write a Python program that implements a multi-threaded web crawler that starts from a given root URL and crawls all the hyperlinks that belong to the same domain. The crawler should respect the following requirements:

1. The program should be able to handle multiple threads to crawl the web pages concurrently.
2. The crawler should only visit each URL once to avoid infinite loops.
3. The crawler should only follow links that are within the same domain as the root URL.
4. The program should handle common exceptions such as network errors or parsing issues without crashing.
5. The program should accept command-line arguments for the host, root path, and character set encoding to use when decoding the web pages.

Design a GraphQL API using Python's Graphene library that allows clients to query a list of coupons and retrieve details about a specific coupon by its unique identifier. The API should be built on top of a Django application with a `Coupon` model.

The `Coupon` model has the following fields:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
- `code`: A string representing the unique code of the coupon.
- `valid_from`: A datetime indicating when the coupon becomes valid.
- `valid_to`: A datetime indicating when the coupon expires.
- `discount`: A float representing the percentage discount the coupon provides.
- `active`: A boolean indicating whether the coupon is active or not.

The GraphQL API should provide two queries:
1. `allCoupons`: Returns a list of all coupons, including their id, code, valid_from, valid_to, discount, and active status.
2. `getCoupon`: Accepts an `id` as an argument and returns the details of the coupon with the matching id.

Ensure that the API handles cases where the coupon with the given id does not exist.

The spider should navigate through the news listing pages and extract the URL, title, and publication date of each news article. The spider should be able to handle pagination and continue crawling until it has visited all listing pages.

The website structure for the news listing pages is as follows:
- Each news listing page contains a table with news articles.
- Each row in the table represents a news article.
- The first column contains the title of the news article wrapped in a font tag within an anchor tag.

Write a Python program that uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The program should perform the following tasks:

1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset by reshaping the images into a 2D array where each row represents an image.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
4. Train an SVM classifier on the training data.
5. Predict the class of a randomly selected image from the test set and display the image alongside the predicted class.
6. Generate and display a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the classifier on the test set.

In a futuristic chemical plant, you are tasked with optimizing the production of a valuable fuel compound. The plant uses a series of chemical reactions, each of which produces a certain amount of one chemical by consuming certain amounts of other chemicals. One of these chemicals is the omnipresent ""ORE,"" which is available in a seemingly infinite amount.

The reactions are defined in a file named `transformations.txt`, where each line describes a reaction in the following format:

```
<number> <input_chemical_1>, <number> <input_chemical_2>, ... => <number> <output_chemical>
```

For example, a line in the file might look like this:

```
7 A, 1 B => 1 C
```

This means that 7 units of chemical A and 1 unit of chemical B can be combined to produce 1 unit of the desired chemical C.

Your goal is to determine the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced using exactly 1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) units of ORE. The reactions may be performed any number of times, but any excess chemicals produced in a reaction are wasted (i.e., they do not carry over to subsequent reactions).

Write a Python program that reads the reaction definitions from `transformations.txt`, and implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced with 1 trillion units of ORE.

Write a Python class that defines a square by its size and allows computing its area, as well as comparing the size of two squares.

The class `Square` should have the following features:

1. An instance attribute `size` that represents the side length of the square. It should be a private attribute to prevent direct access.
2. The `size` attribute should be validated in the constructor (`__init__` method) to ensure that it is an integer and is not negative. If the input is not an integer, raise a `TypeError` with the message `""size must be an integer""`. If the size is negative, raise a `ValueError` with the message `""size must be >= 0""`.
3. A method `area` that returns the area of the square.
4. Magic methods `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__gt__`, and `__ge__` to compare the size of two `Square` instances based on their areas. These methods should enable the use of `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `>=` operators respectively.

Write a Python function `find_rarest_char` that takes a list of strings and prints the uppercase version of the character that appears the least number of times in each string. If there are multiple characters with the same minimum frequency, the function should print the one with the smallest ASCII value. The function should ignore the case of the characters when counting their frequencies but should print the rarest character in uppercase.

For example, given the string ""aabbccd"", the character 'd' appears only once, which is less than any other character, so the function should print 'D'. If the string were ""aabbcc"", where 'a', 'b', and 'c' all appear twice, the function should print 'A' because it has the smallest ASCII value among them.

Design a simple MVC (Model-View-Controller) application in Python that manages a database of students. The application should be able to display all students, add a new student, update a student's name, and delete a student by ID. The database operations are simulated by a class `SinhvienDB` which provides the necessary methods to interact with the data. The `SinhvienController` class is responsible for handling the user input and updating the view.

The `SinhvienDB` class should have the following methods:
- `get_all_sinhvien()`: Returns a list of all students in the database.
- `them_sinhvien(hoten)`: Adds a new student with the given name to the database and returns the ID of the new student.
- `update_sinhvien(hoten, idsinhvien)`: Updates the name of the student with the given ID.
- `delete_sinhvien(idsinhvien)`: Deletes the student with the given ID from the database.

The `SinhvienView` class should have the following methods:
- `display_all_sinhvien(items)`: Displays all the students in the given list.
- `ket_qua_insert(resultID)`: Displays the result of the insert operation.
- `ket_qua_update()`: Displays the result of the update operation.
- `ket_qua_delete()`: Displays the result of the delete operation.

Write the `SinhvienDB` and `SinhvienView` classes and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Create a Python script that provides a command-line interface (CLI) to clean up a Python project directory by removing common temporary files and directories that are generated during development, such as `__pycache__` folders, `.pyc` files, and build artifacts. The script should be able to:

1. Remove specific directories (e.g., `dist`, `build`, `.eggs`) and their contents.
2. Recursively remove directories and files matching certain patterns (e.g., `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`).
3. Remove files matching patterns in specific directories (e.g., `*.png` and `*.yml` files in `docs/test_to_docs`).
4. Provide a dry-run option that lists the files and directories that would be removed without actually deleting them.
5. Print the actions it is taking (e.g., ""Removing: dist/"").

The script should be designed to be run from the command line and accept arguments to specify the project directory to clean and whether to perform a dry run.

To verify the solution correctness, you can create a test project directory with some of the files and directories that should be cleaned up, then run the script with the `--dry-run` option to see what would be removed, and without it to actually clean the directory.

**Test Case**:

1. Create a test project directory with dummy files and directories.
2. Run the script with `--dry-run` to list what would be removed.
3. Run the script without `--dry-run` to perform the cleanup.
4. Verify that the appropriate files and directories have been removed.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python class `PluginManager` that manages different versions of plugins for an ontology management system. Each plugin version should support different capabilities such as importing and exporting ontologies and instances. The provided code snippet represents a basic structure of a plugin version `Plugin_v1`.

Your task is to extend the functionality by implementing the `PluginManager` class with the following requirements:

1. The `PluginManager` should be able to register multiple versions of plugins.
2. Each plugin version should have a unique identifier.
3. The `PluginManager` should provide a method to get a plugin by its version identifier.
4. The `PluginManager` should provide a method to list all registered plugins along with their capabilities.
5. Implement error handling for cases where a plugin version is not found.

Use the provided `Plugin_v1` class as a base class for creating a new plugin version `Plugin_v2` that adds the `CAPABILITY_IMPORT` and `CAPABILITY_EXPORT` capabilities. The `Plugin_v2` should override the `capabilities` method to return its new capabilities.

Design a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that uses an enumeration to define its operations. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and support stack manipulation commands (push, pop, clear). The calculator should use a stack to store numbers and apply operations in RPN order.

The `StackAccessor` class provided in the code snippet should be used to interact with the stack. The `ActionEnum` class should define the operations and their corresponding actions. Each operation should have a method that implements its behavior when called.

The calculator should raise a `StackDepletedError` if an operation is attempted with insufficient operands on the stack. The calculator should also support a verbose mode where each operation prints a message before execution.

Implement the RPN calculator with the following operations:
- `ADD`: Pops two values from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
- `SUB`: Pops two values from the stack, subtracts the second popped value from the first, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
- `MUL`: Pops two values from the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
- `DIV`: Pops two values from the stack, divides the first popped value by the second, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
- `PUSH`: Pushes a value onto the stack.
- `POP`: Pops a value from the stack and returns it.
- `CLEAR`: Clears the stack.

Write a Python program that uses a pre-trained RAFT (Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms) model to compute and visualize the optical flow between pairs of images in a given directory. The program should load a sequence of images, compute the optical flow between consecutive images, and visualize the result. The optical flow should be visualized by overlaying the flow vectors on the first image of each pair.

The program should follow these specifications:

1. The program should accept command-line arguments for the model checkpoint path (`--model`) and the directory containing the images (`--path`).
2. The images should be loaded in alphabetical order based on their filenames.
3. The program should use the RAFT model to compute the optical flow between each consecutive pair of images.
4. The optical flow should be visualized using the `flow_viz.flow_to_image` function provided by the RAFT implementation, which converts the flow vectors to a color-coded image.
5. The visualization should display the original first image and the color-coded flow image side by side.
6. The program should handle both `.png` and `.jpg` image formats.
7. The program should be able to run on a GPU if available, otherwise on a CPU.

Write a Python function `extract_menu_links(html_snippet)` that takes a string containing an HTML snippet as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the text of the menu items (e.g., ""Home"", ""About"", ""Contact"", etc.) and the values are the corresponding URLs (the `href` attribute values).

This solution uses the `HTMLParser` class from Python's built-in `html.parser` module to parse the HTML snippet and extract the menu links. The `MenuParser` class is a subclass of `HTMLParser` and overrides the `handle_starttag`, `handle_data`, and `handle_endtag` methods to build the dictionary of menu links. The `extract_menu_links` function creates an instance of `MenuParser`, feeds the HTML snippet to it, and then returns the dictionary of extracted links. The test case verifies that the function correctly extracts the expected menu links from the provided HTML snippet.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a system that automates the deployment of a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) tournament environment using Docker containers. The system should consist of an eBot server (for managing CS:GO matches), an eBot web interface, and multiple CS:GO game servers. The deployment should be configurable and scalable, allowing for a specified number of game servers to be deployed across multiple physical servers.

The system should meet the following requirements:

1. **eBot Server Deployment**: Deploy an eBot server with a MySQL database and an eBot web interface on a specified IP address. The eBot server should be configured with environment variables necessary for its operation.

2. **CS:GO Game Server Deployment**: Deploy a specified number of CS:GO game servers across the provided list of physical servers. Each game server should be configured with unique ports and environment variables, including a Steam account token for authentication.

3. **Server Registration**: After deploying the CS:GO game servers, register them with the eBot server by adding their details to the eBot's MySQL database.

4. **Configuration and Scalability**: The deployment should be configurable through a YAML file (`config.yml`) that contains necessary details such as the number of game servers, Steam account tokens, and physical server IPs. The system should be scalable to deploy any number of game servers as specified in the configuration.

5. **Logging**: The system should log the deployment details of the eBot server, eBot web interface, and CS:GO game servers to a topology file.

6. **Error Handling**: The system should handle errors gracefully during deployment and registration, providing meaningful error messages.

7. **TLS Configuration**: The system should support TLS configuration for secure communication with the Docker daemon.

8. **Test Cases**: Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the deployment and registration functions.

In a hypothetical simulation of a disease spread, we want to visualize the network of contacts and the potential risk of infection for each individual. Each person in the network is represented as a node, and the connections between them are the edges. The risk of infection is visualized by coloring the nodes based on their ""degrees apart"" from an infected individual. The ""degrees apart"" is an integer representing the minimum number of connections between the person and any infected individual. The closer a person is to an infected individual, the higher their risk, and thus, the more intense the color.

Write a Python program that includes two functions: `degrees_apart_get_colour` and `rgb_to_str`. The `degrees_apart_get_colour` function calculates the color of a node based on its ""degrees apart"" from an infected individual using an exponential decay function. The `rgb_to_str` function converts the RGB color tuple to a string format.

The color intensity should decay exponentially as the ""degrees apart"" increases, starting from the `INFECTED_COLOUR` (red) for an infected individual (0 degrees apart) and approaching white for individuals with a higher ""degrees apart"" value. The color calculation should use the constants `MIN_FILL`, `STRETCH`, and `OFFSET` to control the shape of the exponential decay curve.

The program should include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Django model for a medical appointment system that incorporates site-specific data and historical tracking. The model should be named `Appointment` and inherit from a custom `AppointmentModelMixin`, `SiteModelMixin`, and `BaseUuidModel`. The model should include the following fields:

- `appt_datetime`: A `DateTimeField` that represents the date and time of the appointment. It should have a verbose name ""Appointment date and time"" and include a validator `datetime_not_before_study_start` to ensure the appointment is not scheduled before the start of a study. This field should also be indexed in the database.
- `site`: A `ForeignKey` to the `Site` model from Django's `contrib.sites` framework. The deletion policy should be set to `PROTECT`, and the field should not be editable. It should also have a related name `pre_flourish_appointment_site`.
- `on_site`: An instance of `CurrentSiteManager` to allow filtering by the current site.
- `objects`: An instance of `AppointmentManager`, a custom manager for handling appointment-specific queries.
- `history`: An instance of `HistoricalRecords` to enable historical tracking of changes to appointment records.

The `Appointment` model should also include a `natural_key` method that returns a tuple consisting of `subject_identifier`, `visit_schedule_name`, `schedule_name`, `visit_code`, and `visit_code_sequence`. The `natural_key` should declare a dependency on the `sites.Site` model.

Create a Python program that recommends movies based on a user's input and sorts the recommendations by their Rotten Tomatoes rating. The program should use the TasteDive API to find movies similar to the one provided by the user and then use the OMDb API to retrieve the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for these movies. The recommendations should be sorted in descending order of their ratings, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by the movie title.

The program should consist of the following functions:

1. `get_movies_from_tastedive(name)`: Takes a movie name as input and returns a list of related movies using the TasteDive API.
2. `extract_movie_titles(movie_data)`: Extracts movie titles from the TasteDive API response.
3. `get_related_titles(movie_titles)`: Takes a list of movie titles and returns a unique list of related movies.
4. `get_movie_data(title)`: Retrieves movie data from the OMDb API using the movie title.
5. `get_movie_rating(movie_data)`: Extracts the Rotten Tomatoes rating from the OMDb API response.
6. `get_sorted_recommendations(movie_titles)`: Takes a list of movie titles and returns a sorted dictionary of related movies and their ratings.

The program should also include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Write a Python script that processes a set of compressed JSON files containing author information and generates HTML anchor tags with the authors' names linking to their URLs. The script should be able to handle running both as a standalone script and as part of a Slurm array job. The script should meet the following requirements:

1. If the script is run as part of a Slurm array job, it should use the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` environment variable to determine which file to process. The input file should be named `authors.piece.XXX.gz` and the output file should be named `authors.piece.XXX.url`, where `XXX` is the zero-padded `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.

2. If the script is run as a standalone script (not part of a Slurm array job), it should take the input file name as a command-line argument and write the output to standard output.

3. Each line in the input file is a compressed JSON object with at least two keys: `url` and `name`. The script should read each line, decompress it, parse the JSON, and print an HTML anchor tag in the format `<a href=""URL"">NAME</a>` to the output file or standard output.

4. The script should count the number of errors encountered while processing (e.g., lines that cannot be parsed as JSON) and print the total number of errors to standard error upon completion.

5. The script should use proper error handling to ensure that it does not crash on malformed input.

6. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

# To verify the correctness of the solution, you can create a sample compressed JSON file

# {""url"": ""http://example.com/author2"", ""name"": ""Author Two""}
# Then run the script with `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=1` and without it to check the output.

Create a Python program that simulates a simple version of the classic Pong game's paddle movement. The program should define a `Paddle` class that inherits from the `Turtle` class from the `turtle` module. The `Paddle` class should have the following features:

1. The paddle should be initialized with an x and y position, as well as a color.
2. The paddle should be a rectangle with a stretch width of 5 and a stretch height of 1.
3. The paddle should be able to move up and down within the screen limits defined by `MAX_UP_POS` and `MAX_DOWN_POS`. The paddle should not be able to move beyond these limits.
4. The paddle should move by a fixed distance defined by `MOVE_DISTANCE` when the `move_up` or `move_down` methods are called.

The `qRIMBlock` should be capable of reconstructing undersampled k-space data while simultaneously estimating the quantitative maps.

The `qRIMBlock` class should have the following features:
- It should be implemented using PyTorch and leverage its automatic differentiation capabilities.
- The class should accept a variety of hyperparameters to configure the convolutional and recurrent layers within the RIM block.
- It should include a forward pass method that takes as input the masked k-space data, initial estimates of the quantitative maps (R2*, S0, B0, and phi), echo times (TEs), sensitivity maps, and a sampling mask. The forward pass should output the reconstructed quantitative maps and optionally the hidden states of the recurrent layers.
- The class should use a provided linear forward model to simulate the MEGRE sequence and calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the quantitative maps.
- The class should handle multi-coil data and include options for coil combination methods such as SENSE.
- The class should be robust to NaN values in the gradient computation and normalize the gradients to prevent exploding gradients.

Write a Python class `FacebookVideoPlayer` that simulates the behavior of playing random Facebook videos using the Selenium WebDriver. The class should be able to:

1. Initialize with a Selenium WebDriver instance and a logger object.
2. Fetch a random Facebook video URL from a predefined list.
3. Play the video by navigating to the URL and simulating a click on the play button.
4. Retrieve the maximum video length (in seconds) from the video's attributes.
5. Log the video play time and wait time between videos.
6. Handle exceptions by logging errors and attempting to play another random video.
7. Implement a method to simulate random wait times between playing videos.

The class should not actually change the video resolution or interact with any settings pages. It should simulate the behavior as if it were interacting with the Facebook interface.

Write a Python program that converts a GTF (Gene Transfer Format) file to a BED (Browser Extensible Data) file. The GTF file contains information about gene features, such as exons, transcripts, and genes, and is commonly used for annotation in genomic studies. The BED format is a simpler format used for displaying such features in genome browsers.

The program should:
- Take the path to a GTF file and the desired output paths for the BED file and a SQLite database file as input.
- Create a SQLite database from the GTF file using the `gffutils` package.
- Extract transcript features from the database and convert them to BED12 format.
- Write the BED12 formatted features to the output BED file, ensuring that the transcript ID is used as the name field in the BED file.

The BED12 format consists of 12 columns:
1. chrom - The name of the chromosome
2. chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome
3. chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome
4. name - The name of the feature (use the transcript ID)
5. score - A score between 0 and 1000 (use '.' to indicate no score)
6. strand - The strand of the feature ('+' or '-')
7. thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays)
8. thickEnd - The ending position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the stop codon in gene displays)
9. itemRgb - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (use '0' to indicate no color)
10. blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the feature
11. blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the sizes of the blocks
12. blockStarts - A comma-separated list of the starting positions of the blocks relative to chromStart

Design a language model evaluation suite that includes functions to calculate accuracy, perplexity, BLEU score, and distinct n-gram metrics for a given set of predictions and target sequences. The suite should be able to handle padding in the sequences and provide options for weighting different tokens in the perplexity calculation. The evaluation metrics should be as follows:

1. **Accuracy**: Calculate the token-level accuracy, ignoring padding tokens if a padding index is provided.
2. **Perplexity**: Compute the perplexity of the predictions with respect to the targets. If a padding index is provided, ignore those tokens in the calculation. Optionally, provide a weight for each token in the vocabulary.
3. **BLEU Score**: Calculate BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 scores for a list of hypothesis and reference sequences. Use smoothing method 7 for handling cases where n-gram matches are not found.
4. **Distinct N-grams**: Compute both intra- and inter-distinct metrics for unigrams and bigrams in the predicted sequences. Intra-distinct measures the diversity within each sequence, while inter-distinct measures the diversity across all sequences.

The evaluation suite should be implemented in Python using PyTorch for tensor operations and NLTK for BLEU score calculation. The suite should be able to handle sequences of varying lengths and batch sizes.

Design a smart home system that manages bedtime routines through a command interpreter service. The system should be able to handle different states related to sleep and emergency situations. The states are as follows:

1. `GetOutOfBed`: The initial state when the user is expected to get out of bed.
2. `SleepPreparation`: The state where the system prepares the environment for the user to go to sleep (e.g., dimming lights, playing soft music).
3. `TrueSleep`: The state indicating the user is asleep. The system should ensure minimal disturbance (e.g., turning off music).
4. `NightEmergency`: A special state that can be triggered at any time indicating an emergency situation during the night (e.g., turning on lights, alerting the user).

The system should also support smart bedtime management, which restricts state transitions during certain hours of the day. The command interpreter service should handle button input commands to transition between these states and publish state change notifications. Additionally, it should handle modifier commands to increase or decrease settings (e.g., volume, brightness).

Implement the `CommandInterpreterService` class with the following methods:

- `initialize()`: Initializes the service with configurations and subscribes to button input commands.
- `handleButtonInput(buttonInput)`: Handles button input commands to transition between states and publishes state change notifications.
- `getForwardMovingState(previousState)`: Returns the next state in the sequence.
- `getBackwardMovingState(previousState)`: Returns the previous state in the sequence.

The button input types are defined as follows:

- `UpLong`: Move to the next state in the sequence.
- `DownLong`: Move to the previous state in the sequence.
- `UpDownLong`: Toggle the `NightEmergency` state.
- `UpShort`: Publish a modifier increase notification.
- `DownShort`: Publish a modifier decrease notification.

A robotics company is developing an autonomous robot for search and rescue missions. The robot is equipped with flame sensors and is tasked with navigating through an environment to locate and extinguish a fire. The provided code snippet is part of the robot's control system, which uses ROS (Robot Operating System) for communication and control.

Your task is to write a Python script that implements the following functionalities:

1. Initialize a ROS node named 'en_Mapping'.
2. Subscribe to two ROS topics:
   - ""/start"" which receives a `Bool` message indicating whether the robot should start its mission.
   - ""/flame_sensors"" which receives a `String` message containing space-separated sensor readings.
3. Publish commands to two ROS topics:
   - ""/trin_base_controller/cmd_vel"" to control the robot's velocity using `Twist` messages.
   - ""/servo_toggle"" to signal when to extinguish the fire using `Empty` messages.
4. Implement a function `navigateToRoom()` that launches a ROS launch file to start exploration and waits until the flame sensors detect a significant reading (greater than 100).
5. Implement a function `navigateToFlame()` that navigates the robot towards the flame based on sensor readings, using a proportional control approach.
6. Implement a function `extinguishFlame()` that performs a series of movements to ensure the fire is extinguished.

The robot should start navigating to the room when the ""/start"" topic receives a `True` message and should navigate to the flame and attempt to extinguish it once the flame sensors detect a fire.

Design a Python class named `BenchmarkData` that is capable of loading and handling benchmark datasets for machine learning tasks. The class should support loading the MNIST dataset and allow for the selection of a subset of classes from the dataset. The class should have the following features:

1. Initialization should take two parameters: `dataset_type` and `data_path`. The `dataset_type` should be an enum `DataSetType` with at least one member `MNIST`. The `data_path` is the path to the dataset directory.
2. The class should have attributes `inputs` and `targets` to store the dataset's features and labels, respectively.
3. If the `data_path` is not provided during initialization, the class should raise a `TypeError`.
4. If a non-existent dataset type is provided, the class should raise an `Exception`.
5. The class should have an optional parameter `classes` during initialization, which allows loading only a subset of classes from the dataset. If `classes` is specified, the `targets` attribute should only contain the specified number of unique classes.

Write a test suite using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the `BenchmarkData` class. The test suite should include the following test cases:

1. Test that the MNIST data is loaded correctly with non-empty `inputs` and `targets` attributes, and that the number of inputs matches the number of targets.
2. Test that when a subset of classes is specified, the `targets` attribute contains only the specified number of unique classes.
3. Test that initializing `BenchmarkData` without a `data_path` raises a `TypeError`.
4. Test that initializing `BenchmarkData` with a non-existent dataset type raises an `Exception`.

Write a Python script that reads customer feedback from text files stored in a directory and posts the feedback to a web server using HTTP POST requests. Each text file contains feedback from a single customer and follows a specific format where the first line is the title of the feedback, the second line is the customer's name, the third line is the date of the feedback, and the fourth line is the feedback text itself.

Your script should:
- Read all `.txt` files from a specified directory.
- Extract the feedback information from each file and store it in a dictionary with keys: `'title'`, `'name'`, `'date'`, and `'feedback'`.
- Post each feedback dictionary to a web server using the `requests` library.
- Handle any potential errors during the HTTP POST request and print appropriate messages to the console.

You are tasked with creating a custom Django admin interface for a recipe management application. The application has a custom user model and additional models for tags, ingredients, and recipes. The custom user model includes fields for email, name, password, is_active, is_staff, is_superuser, and last_login. Tags and ingredients have a simple name field, while recipes have fields for title, ingredients (many-to-many relationship with Ingredient model), tags (many-to-many relationship with Tag model), and a user (foreign key to the custom User model).

Your goal is to enhance the Django admin interface to provide a user-friendly way to manage these models. The User model should have a custom admin interface that allows for easy viewing and editing of user details. The Tag, Ingredient, and Recipe models should also be registered with the admin site with default configurations.

- Each dictionary represents a different agent class.
- The key `@class` contains a list with a single string element representing the class name.
- Other keys represent parameter names, and their values are lists of possible values for that parameter.

For example, given the following input list:

```python
AGENT_PARAMS = [
    {
        ""@class"": [""AgentA""],
        ""param1"": [1, 2],
        ""param2"": [""x"", ""y""],
    },
    {
        ""@class"": [""AgentB""],
        ""param1"": [3],
        ""param3"": [True, False],
    },
]
```

The function should generate a DataFrame with the following rows (the order of rows does not matter):

```
  agent_class  param1 param2 param3
0       AgentA       1      x    NaN
1       AgentA       1      y    NaN
2       AgentA       2      x    NaN
3       AgentA       2      y    NaN

Design a Django migration that adds a new field to an existing model. The new field should be a `CharField` representing a unique identifier for each record in the model named `unique_id`. The field should have a maximum length of 32 characters, be required (non-nullable), and have a default value generated by a custom function that creates a random alphanumeric string of 32 characters.

The model to be updated is named `Item` and belongs to the Django app named `inventory`. Assume that the `Item` model already exists and has other fields not relevant to this migration.

Write a Django migration script that performs the following operations:
1. Adds the new `unique_id` field to the `Item` model with the specified attributes.
2. Populates the `unique_id` field for existing records in the database with unique random alphanumeric strings.

Ensure that the migration is reversible, meaning that the `unique_id` field should be removed if the migration is rolled back.

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would typically run the migration on a test database and check if the `unique_id` field is added correctly and populated with unique values.

You are tasked with creating a Python script that automates the management of AWS Security Hub standards and controls for multiple regions within an AWS account. The script should enable a specific standard, disable another, and update the status of certain controls within the enabled standard. Additionally, the script should verify the status of the Security Hub, the enabled standard, and the controls in all specified regions.

The script should perform the following actions:

1. Enable the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard (AFSBP) in each region from a predefined list.
2. Disable the Center for Internet Security (CIS) AWS Foundations Benchmark standard in each region for a given member account.
3. Disable a list of controls within the AFSBP standard for the given member account in each region.
4. Verify that the Security Hub is enabled in each region.
5. Verify that the AFSBP standard is enabled and in the 'INCOMPLETE' or 'READY' status in each region for the given member account.
6. Verify that the specified controls within the AFSBP standard are disabled in each region for the given member account.

The script should log all actions taken and any errors encountered. If any step fails in any region, the script should raise an exception after attempting all actions in all regions.

Write a Python script that implements the above requirements, including appropriate error handling and logging. Use the given code snippet as a starting point, and ensure that all necessary AWS SDK (boto3) clients and methods are used correctly.

Create a Python class named `ConfigManager` that provides an interface for managing a configuration system similar to the one described in the given code snippet. The class should implement methods for adding, checking, retrieving, and removing sections and options, as well as setting and getting option values with auto-coercion of types. The class should also handle permissions by checking if an issuer has the right to perform a given action before proceeding with it.

The `ConfigManager` class should use an internal dictionary to store the configuration data and a separate dictionary to store permissions for different issuers. The permissions dictionary will map issuer names to sets of allowed actions.

Implement the following methods in the `ConfigManager` class:
- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the configuration and permissions dictionaries.
- `add_permission(self, issuer, action)`: Adds a permission for an issuer to perform a specific action.
- `has_permission(self, issuer, action)`: Checks if an issuer has permission to perform a specific action.
- All the methods described in the given code snippet, adapted to work with the internal dictionaries instead of external modules.

Auto-coercion rules for the `get` method should be as follows:
- If the value is a string that matches 'on', 'off', 'true', 'false', 'yes', or 'no' (case-insensitive), it should be converted to a boolean.
- If the value is a string that can be converted to an integer or a float without loss of information, it should be converted accordingly.
- Otherwise, the value should be returned as a string.

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and performs a division operation. The program should handle two types of exceptions: `ZeroDivisionError` when the user attempts to divide by zero, and `ValueError` when the user inputs are not valid integers.

Design a Python application that simulates a timer with start, stop, and reset functionalities using a GUI. The application should be able to handle asynchronous events from a simulated ""engine"" that sends messages about the timer's status. The GUI should display the elapsed time and update in real-time as the timer runs. The application should use the wxPython library for the GUI, the `pubsub` library for handling publish-subscribe messaging, and threading to handle asynchronous events without freezing the GUI.

The application should have the following features:
1. A start button to begin the timer.
2. A stop button to pause the timer.
3. A reset button to reset the timer to zero.
4. A display that shows the elapsed time in seconds.
5. A progress bar that fills up as the timer counts up to a predefined maximum time.
6. The ability to handle messages from the engine such as 'updateTimer', 'sessionFinished', and 'timerDone'.
7. The ability to send requests to the engine such as 'start', 'stop', and 'exit'.
8. Proper logging for debugging purposes.

The GUI should be responsive and should not freeze during operation. The application should also handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user when an unimplemented feature is accessed.

The list of prime numbers `primes` is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order, and the following constraints must be met:
- `1` is considered a super ugly number for any given list of `primes`.
- The length of `primes` (`k`) is such that `0 < k ≤ 100`.
- The value of `n` is such that `0 < n ≤ 10^6`.
- Each prime in `primes` is such that `0 < primes[i] < 1000`.

Write a Python program that processes a collection of videos to extract images of hand gestures, which are then used to create a dataset for training a machine learning model for hand gesture recognition. The program should follow these steps:

1. Clean the existing dataset by removing all images from the training directory.
2. Process each video in a given directory to extract images of hand gestures.
3. For each frame of the video, use a pre-defined function `extract_hand` to extract the hand region, which should be cropped and resized to a fixed size.
4. Display the extracted hand image in a window with the title indicating the number of fingers shown in the gesture.
5. Save the extracted hand image to a corresponding class folder within the training data directory. The class is determined by the number of fingers shown, which is indicated by the first character of the video filename.
6. Allow the user to interact with the extraction process using keyboard inputs:
   - Press 'q' to quit the extraction process immediately.
   - Press the spacebar to pause the video.
   - Press 's' to skip the current video and move on to the next one.
7. Once all frames of a video have been processed or skipped, move on to the next video.
8. After all videos have been processed, release all resources and close any open windows.

The program should be robust, handle exceptions, and provide feedback to the user about the progress of the extraction process.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have a set of test videos and the `image_preprocessing` module with the `extract_hand` function implemented. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, we cannot provide actual test cases. However, you can test the program by following these steps:

1. Create a directory named `videos` and place some sample videos with filenames indicating the number of fingers shown (e.g., `5_reduced.mp4` for a video showing a hand with five fingers).
2. Implement the `extract_hand` function in the `image_preprocessing` module. This function should take a frame, crop the hand region, and resize it to the specified dimensions.
3. Create the necessary directories within the `data/train` folder corresponding to the number of fingers (e.g., `data/train/5` for five fingers).
4. Run the program and check if the images are being extracted, displayed, and saved correctly in the respective directories.
5. Use keyboard inputs to test the interactive features (quit, pause, skip).
6. Ensure that the `clean_data_dir` function is removing images from the training directory before starting the extraction process.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a function `check_parentheses_balance` that takes a list of strings and returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each string has balanced parentheses or not. A string has balanced parentheses if each opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and the parentheses are properly nested.

For example, the string ""((()))"" is balanced, but the string ""(()"" is not.

The function should follow these rules:
- It should take a list of strings as input.
- It should return a list of boolean values, where each boolean value corresponds to the input string at the same index.
- The function should be able to handle an empty string, which is considered balanced.

Here is the function signature:

```python
def check_parentheses_balance(strings: List[str]) -> List[bool]:
    """"""
    Checks if each string in the list has balanced parentheses.

    :param strings: A list of strings to be checked for balanced parentheses.

```

The solution provided defines the function `check_parentheses_balance` which iterates through each string in the input list, using a stack-like counter to track the balance of parentheses.

Write a Python program that interacts with the Binance API to fetch historical cryptocurrency data and converts it into a well-structured Excel file. The program should allow the user to specify the cryptocurrency symbols, the time interval for the data, and the start and end dates for the data retrieval. The Excel file should contain columns for Date, Time, Opening Price, High Price, Low Price, Closing Price, and Volume in Lots.

The program should follow these steps:
1. Prompt the user to enter one or more cryptocurrency symbols (e.g., 'BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT') and store them in a list.
2. Prompt the user to select a time interval from the provided options (e.g., '1m', '1h', '1d').
3. Prompt the user to enter the start and end dates for the data retrieval in a specific format (e.g., '6 March 2017').
4. Fetch the historical data from the Binance API for each cryptocurrency symbol within the specified time interval and date range.
5. Convert the fetched data into a CSV file for each symbol.
6. Read the CSV file and transform it into a Pandas DataFrame with the specified columns.
7. Export the DataFrame to an Excel file with a proper header format.

The program should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the API call or data processing and provide appropriate messages to the user.

The `Animal` class should have an `__init__` method that takes a name as an argument and stores it. It should also have a `introduce` method that prints out ""And my pet's name is {name}"".

The `Toy` class should have a static method `introduce_toy` that takes a name as an argument and prints out ""My toy's name is {name}"".

The program should also demonstrate the following list operations:
- Creating a list of users and adding elements to it.
- Inserting elements at specific positions.
- Slicing the list to get a subset of elements.
- Copying the list.
- Using list comprehension to create a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10.

Design a Python program that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage client information and their associated phone numbers. The program should be able to create tables for clients and phone numbers, add new clients, add phone numbers for existing clients, update client information, delete phone numbers, delete clients, and search for clients based on given criteria.

The `DataBase` class should handle the creation of tables and the `Client` class should manage client information and operations. The program should ensure that the `client` table contains columns for the client's first name, last name, email (which should be unique), and an optional phone number. The `phones` table should store multiple phone numbers associated with a client, referenced by the client's ID.

1. Create tables for clients and phones with the necessary columns and constraints.
2. Add a new client to the database with their information.
3. Add a phone number for an existing client.
4. Update existing client information based on their client ID.
5. Delete a specific phone number for a client.
6. Delete a client from the database based on their client ID.

Consider a binary tree where each node contains an integer value. Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf sequences are the same. The leaf sequence is the sequence of values formed by the leaf nodes in the tree from left to right.

Write a function `leafSimilar` that takes two binary tree root nodes as inputs and returns `True` if the two trees are leaf-similar, otherwise `False`.

A binary tree node is defined by the class `TreeNode`. Implement the `TreeNode` class and the `Solution` class with the `leafSimilar` method as described below:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

Design a PyTorch Lightning model for predicting future frames in a video sequence using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network. The model should be capable of taking a sequence of frames as input and predicting the next set of frames in the sequence. The dataset consists of simulated pool table videos where balls are moving in a confined space, and the task is to predict their future positions.

The model should include the following features:
- A ConvLSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture for sequence prediction.
- A custom loss function that penalizes the model based on the difference between the predicted and actual future frames.
- A method to create a video grid that shows the input sequence, the predicted sequence, and the actual sequence for visualization purposes.
- Training and testing data loaders that load sequences of frames from the PoolTable dataset.
- Configuration of the Adam optimizer with customizable learning rate and beta parameters.
- Training and testing steps that include logging of losses and learning rates.
- A method to configure data loaders for training and testing.
- Mixed-precision training support if enabled.
- Multi-GPU support for distributed training.

The provided code snippet should be used as a starting point for implementing the model, data loaders, and training/testing procedures. The model should be trained and tested using the PyTorch Lightning framework, and the results should be logged using TensorBoard.

Write a Python program that uses the `NessusChecker` class provided to check if a given file contains any patterns that indicate the presence of a Nessus library and extract its version number if available. The program should be able to read the contents of a file, search for the specified patterns, and output the findings.

The program should follow these specifications:

1. It should define a function `check_nessus_presence_and_version(file_content)` that takes a string argument `file_content` which represents the content of a file to be checked.
2. The function should return a tuple `(is_present, version)` where:
   - `is_present` is a boolean indicating whether any Nessus-related patterns are found in the file content.
   - `version` is a string representing the extracted version number of the Nessus library if found, or `None` if not found.
3. The program should handle multiple occurrences of version patterns gracefully, returning the first match found.
4. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a speaker verification system that evaluates the performance of a given speaker recognition model. The system should be able to perform two types of tests: False Rejection Tests and False Acceptance Tests. The False Rejection Test should verify how often the system incorrectly rejects an actual speaker, while the False Acceptance Test should verify how often the system incorrectly accepts an impostor as the actual speaker.

The system should be able to read a directory containing subdirectories for each speaker, where each subdirectory contains audio files in `.wav` format. The system should also maintain a `TestsData.csv` file that records the number of tests performed and the corresponding error rates for each speaker.

Implement the following functions:

1. `TestAccept(SPEAKER)`: This function should perform the False Rejection Test for a given speaker. It should count the number of audio files for the speaker, perform verification using an external `Verification` function from the `Training-Verification` module, and calculate the False Rejection Rate. The results should be updated in the `TestsData.csv` file.

2. `RejectionTest(SPEAKER)`: This function should perform the False Acceptance Test for a given speaker. It should iterate over audio files from other speakers (impostors), perform verification, and calculate the False Acceptance Rate. The results should be updated in the `TestsData.csv` file.

The `Verification` function from the `Training-Verification` module is assumed to take three arguments: the speaker's name, the path to the audio file, and a flag `ReturnTheta` (which should always be 'n' in this context). It returns `1` if the verification is successful (i.e., the speaker is correctly recognized or an impostor is correctly rejected) and `0` otherwise.

Write a function that takes the root node of a binary search tree and returns a new tree that is a mirror image of the original tree. The mirror image of a tree is formed by swapping the left and right children of all nodes at each level.

The TreeNode class and the insert method are provided to create and populate the binary search tree. The Solution class contains the method `invertTree` which should be implemented to perform the inversion.

The input will be a series of test cases. The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of test cases. For each test case, there will be a single line containing integers separated by spaces, representing the values to be inserted into the binary search tree in the given order.

The output should be the pre-order traversal of the inverted binary search trees for each test case, with the values separated by spaces.

Example:

Input:
```
2
4 2 7 1 3 6 9
3 1 4
```

Output:
```
4 7 9 6 2 3 1
3 4 1

Explanation:
For the first test case, the original binary search tree is:

```
    4
   / \
  2   7
 / \ / \
1  3 6  9
```

After inversion, the binary search tree becomes:

```
    4
   / \
  7   2
 / \ / \
9  6 3  1

The pre-order traversal of the inverted tree is `4 7 9 6 2 3 1`.

Create a custom event filter in PyQt that allows a QScrollBar to respond to mouse clicks by moving the slider directly to the click position. The scrollbar should move the slider to the position clicked by the user, considering the orientation and layout direction of the scrollbar. The event filter should be applied to both vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

The event filter should subclass `eventfilters.BaseEventFilter` and override the `eventFilter` method to handle `MouseMove` and `MouseButtonPress` events. When the left mouse button is pressed or moved, the slider should jump to the corresponding position on the scrollbar.

Implement the `SliderMoveToMouseClickEventFilter` class with the following methods:
- `_move_to_mouse_position`: A private method that calculates the new value of the scrollbar based on the mouse click position and sets the scrollbar's value.
- `eventFilter`: An overridden method that filters events for the scrollbar and calls `_move_to_mouse_position` when appropriate.

Provide a simple PyQt application that demonstrates the functionality of the custom event filter with a `QPlainTextEdit` widget containing enough text to require scrolling. Install the event filter on the vertical scrollbar of the `QPlainTextEdit` widget.

Design a Django model for a user management system where each user has a unique username, a password, and an email address. The username should be no longer than 20 characters, the password should be hashed and no longer than 100 characters to accommodate the hash, and the email should be unique and valid. Additionally, include a timestamp for when the user account was created and last updated.

Implement a method within the model that checks if a given password matches the hashed password stored in the database. For password hashing, use `pbkdf2_sha256` from Django's built-in `django.contrib.auth.hashers` module.

Write a Django model that fulfills these requirements and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the password checking method.

Design a Python function `create_server_info` that takes in various parameters to create a new `ServerInfo` object, which represents a server asset in a Django application. The function should validate the input parameters and save the new server asset to the database. The `ServerInfo` model has already been provided.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:

1. The `hostname` should be a string with a maximum length of 64 characters. If it is not provided or is an empty string, the function should raise a ValueError.
2. The `manage_ip` should be a valid IP address. If it is not provided or is an invalid IP, the function should raise a ValueError.
3. The `usage` should be a string with a maximum length of 64 characters. It can be optional.
4. The `system` should be one of the choices provided ('ubuntu', 'centos7'). If an invalid choice is provided, the function should raise a ValueError.
5. The `cpu` should be an integer representing the number of CPUs. If it is not provided, it can be optional.
6. The `mem` should be a string representing the memory size with a maximum length of 32 characters. It can be optional.
7. The `disk_total` should be a string representing the total disk space. It can be optional.
8. The `is_active` should be a boolean indicating whether the server is active or not. It defaults to True.

Design a Python program using PySpark to process weather data from a text file. The data is semi-structured with each line representing a weather record for a station on a specific date. The fields in each line are separated by semicolons (`;`). The program should filter out invalid lines, transform the data into a structured format, and save the processed data into a new text file. Additionally, the program should be able to read the saved data and create a DataFrame with a specified schema.

The weather data contains the following fields:
- Station code (string)
- Date in the format YYYYMMDD (string)
- Temperature in Kelvin (string, convert to Celsius)
- Relative humidity in percentage (string, convert to a float)
- Visibility in meters (string, convert to an integer)
- Atmospheric pressure in hPa (string, convert to a float in kPa)

The program should perform the following tasks:
1. Initialize a SparkSession with an appropriate application name.
2. Read the weather data from a text file located at `/user/spark/donnees/meteo.txt`.
3. Filter out lines that do not start with a digit.
4. Replace occurrences of 'mq' with '0' in the data.

Create a Python program that simulates a remote control for a music player application. The remote control should be able to send commands to the music player over a network using UDP. The commands include play, pause, next track, previous track, volume up, and volume down. Each command is associated with a specific button press on the remote control.

The program should use the `getch` module to capture single keypresses without the need to press Enter and should map the following keys to the corresponding commands:

- 'p': Play/Pause
- 'n': Next Track
- 'b': Previous Track
- '+': Volume Up
- '-': Volume Down
- 'q': Quit the program

When a key is pressed, the corresponding command should be sent over the network to the specified IP address and port. The command should be encoded as a byte array containing the command identifier and any necessary data.

The program should also handle the case where the user presses a key that is not mapped to any command, in which case it should ignore the keypress and continue waiting for the next keypress.

while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)  # buffer size is 1024 bytes
    print(f""Received command: {data[0]} from {addr}"")

The `Action` class should use the `Hypervisor` class from the `cloud.hypervisor` module to interact with the VM instances. Additionally, the class should resolve the IP address of a VM given its hostname using the `dns.resolver` module before initiating an SSH connection.

Implement the `Action` class with the following methods:
- `up(self, guest)`: If the `guest` is `'undefined'`, create it using the hypervisor. If the `guest` is not `'running'`, start it.
- `stop(self, guest)`: If the `guest` is `'running'`, stop it.
- `down(self, guest)`: If the `guest` is not `'undefined'`, destroy it.
- `go(self, hostname)`: Resolve the IP address of the `hostname` and initiate an SSH connection to it.

The `Guest` class should be structured as follows:
```python
class Guest:
    def __init__(self, name, state='undefined'):
        self.name = name
        self.state = state
```

","

    def __init__(self):
        self.hypervisor = Hypervisor()

    def up(self, guest):

    # Test go method (This will actually try to SSH, so it's commented out)
    # action.go(""vm1.example.com"")  # Should resolve IP and SSH to the guest
```

Note: The `Hypervisor` class and its methods (`create`, `start`, `stop`, `destroy`) are assumed to be implemented in the `cloud.hypervisor` module. The `dns.resolver` module is used to resolve the IP address of the given hostname. The `os.system` call is used to initiate an SSH connection, which will work in a real environment but is not practical for automated testing, so the actual SSH test case is commented out.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In an aquatic simulation, we have a unique species of fish that has a fixed lifecycle. Each fish starts with an internal timer set to a value between 0 and 8, inclusive. At the end of each day, the internal timer of each fish decreases by 1. When a fish's timer reaches 0, it resets to 6, and a new fish is created with the timer starting at 8.

The provided `Fishies` class models this behavior. The class is initialized with a list of integers representing the starting timers for a collection of fish. The `inc_day` method simulates the passing of a single day, updating the timers and creating new fish as necessary. The `__len__` method returns the total number of fish, and the `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the current state of the fish population.

Your task is to write a function `simulate_fish_population(initial_fish_timers, days)` that uses the `Fishies` class to simulate the fish population over a given number of days. The function should return the total number of fish at the end of the simulation.

Design a Python class `BrightestStarPredictor` that utilizes the NASA API to find the brightest fireball event based on the energy radiated. The class should be able to filter the fireball events based on latitude and longitude coordinates and a specified buffer range. The class should also handle exceptions such as data not found or API request timeouts.

The class should have the following methods:
- `fireball(coords)`: Takes a tuple of latitude and longitude coordinates and returns the brightest fireball event within the specified buffer range. The event should be returned as a tuple containing the energy, latitude, and longitude of the fireball event.
- `_get_dataframe(data)`: A static method that takes JSON data from the NASA API and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
- `prepare_dataframe(df)`: A static method that takes a pandas DataFrame and performs necessary data manipulations, including updating latitude and longitude signs based on direction and filtering the relevant fields.
- `_filter_dataframe(df, coords)`: Filters the DataFrame based on the given coordinates and buffer range.

The class should also handle custom exceptions such as `DataNotFoundError` when no data is returned from the API.

Create a Python function named `fetch_and_process_products` that retrieves product data from a mock online store API and processes it into a standardized format. The function should use the `httpx` library to make HTTP GET requests to the API endpoint, which simulates fetching product data from a category page of an online store. The API endpoint URL is `https://web-api.service.mockstore.com/search`.

Each product in the response is represented as a dictionary with various details, including a product ID (`pid`), name, brand, price information, and manufacturer part numbers (`mpns`). The function should process these details and return a list of `Product` objects, which are instances of a custom class that standardizes the product information.

The `Product` class should have the following attributes:
- `media_type`: An enum value of type `MediaType` representing the type of media the product is associated with.
- `connection_type`: An enum value of type `ConnectionType` representing the type of connection the product uses.
- `id`: A string identifier for the product, prefixed with `""verk:""` followed by the product's `pid`.
- `source`: A string representing the source of the product data, in this case, `""mockstore""`.
- `name`: The name of the product.
- `size_mb`: The size of the product in megabytes, extracted from the product's name using the `get_mb_size_from_name` function.
- `original_price`: The original price of the product.
- `current_price`: The current price of the product.
- `url`: A URL string to the product page, constructed using the product's `pid`.
- `vendor_sku`: The vendor SKU, which is the first manufacturer part number if available, otherwise an empty string.
- `manufacturer`: The canonicalized name of the manufacturer, obtained using the `canonicalize_vendor` function.
- `_original`: The original raw product data dictionary.

The `fetch_and_process_products` function should accept the following parameters:
- `category_id`: A string representing the category ID to fetch products for.
- `media_type`: An instance of `MediaType`.
- `connection_type`: An instance of `ConnectionType`.

The function should handle pagination by continuously fetching pages until no more products are returned. It should also log the page number being fetched using the `logging` module.

Write a Python function `install_package_on_nodes` that automates the installation of software packages on a set of nodes in a distributed system. The function should be able to handle both `.rpm` and `.deb` package formats and should be able to install packages on nodes with different operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS). The function should also check if the package is already installed and skip the installation if it is. If the package is not installed, it should be downloaded to a temporary directory on the target node, installed, and then the temporary directory should be cleaned up.

The function should take the following parameters:
- `pkg_path`: The file path or URL to the package to be installed.
- `node_list`: A list of strings representing the hostnames or IP addresses of the nodes where the package should be installed.
- `user`: The username to use for connecting to the nodes (default to the current user).
- `password`: The password to use for connecting to the nodes (optional, if not provided, assume SSH key-based authentication).

The function should print out the status of the installation on each node (e.g., ""Package already installed on node x.x.x.x"", ""Package installed successfully on node x.x.x.x"", ""Failed to install package on node x.x.x.x"").

Additionally, it should provide analytics for the most searched artists. The application should also have an admin login that allows access to the analytics data.

The application should have the following endpoints:

1. `/signup/` - Allows new users to sign up by providing a username and password.
2. `/login/` - Allows users to log in using their username and password.
3. `/admin_login/` - Allows admin users to log in using their username and password.
4. `/search/` - Allows authenticated users to search for music artists and view their information, top tracks, and top albums.
5. `/similar/` - Allows authenticated users to view artists similar to a given artist.
6. `/analytics/` - Allows admin users to view the top 10 most searched artists.

The application should use Django's built-in authentication system for user management and should ensure that only authenticated users can access the search and similar artists endpoints. The analytics endpoint should only be accessible to admin users.

1. A menu bar with a ""File"" menu that includes:
   - ""Save as"" option to save the edited image.
   - ""Exit"" option to close the application.
2. A sidebar with buttons to perform the following actions:
   - ""Rotate"" to rotate the image by a user-specified number of degrees.
   - ""Scale"" to resize the image to user-specified dimensions.
   - ""Grayscale"" to convert the image to grayscale.
3. A main area to display the image being edited.
4. Upon launching, the application should prompt the user to select an image file to edit.

The application should be robust, handling user input errors gracefully and providing feedback where necessary.

Write a function `count_valid_sequences` that takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` as input and returns the number of valid sequences that can be formed with the elements of `a` under the following conditions:

- The sequence must be of length `n`.
- If `n` is odd, the sequence must start with `0` and then every pair of consecutive elements must be equal and appear exactly twice in the sequence (except for `0` which appears only once).
- If `n` is even, every pair of consecutive elements must be equal and appear exactly twice in the sequence.
- The sequence must be a permutation of the list `a`.

The function should return the count of such valid sequences modulo `10**9+7`.

For example, if `n = 3` and `a = [0, 2, 2]`, there is only one valid sequence `[0, 2, 2]`. If `n = 4` and `a = [1, 1, 3, 3]`, there is only one valid sequence `[1, 1, 3, 3]`.

Write a Python program that generates the prime factorization of all numbers from 2 up to a given number `n`. The prime factorization of a number is a list of the prime numbers that multiply together to form that number. For example, the prime factorization of 18 is [2, 3, 3] because 2 * 3 * 3 = 18.

Your program should define a function `generate_prime_factorizations(n)` that returns a dictionary where the keys are the numbers from 2 to `n` and the values are lists representing the prime factorization of each number.

For instance, calling `generate_prime_factorizations(5)` should return `{2: [2], 3: [3], 4: [2, 2], 5: [5]}`.

Additionally, write a function `print_prime_factorizations(factorizations)` that takes the dictionary returned by `generate_prime_factorizations` and prints the prime factorizations in a readable format, one per line. For example, the output for `n = 5` should look like:

```
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2 2
5 = 5

Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing food items and their corresponding calorie counts per serving. The program should provide an interactive command-line interface that allows users to query the calorie count for a given food item. If the food item is not found in the CSV file, the program should inform the user that the item is not in the database.

The CSV file is expected to have two columns: the first column contains the food item name, and the second column contains the calorie count per serving. Each line in the CSV file represents a different food item.

Your task is to implement the `read_csv` function to parse the CSV file into a dictionary, where the keys are food item names and the values are calorie counts. You should also implement the `input_loop` function to handle user input and look up calorie counts in the dictionary.

Additionally, write a `main` function that initializes the program by reading the CSV file and entering the input loop. The program should be executable from the command line by passing the CSV filename as an argument.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.

Design a Python class `TextAnalysis` that performs analysis on a given text dataset. The class should be capable of training a Word2Vec model to learn word embeddings from the text data, identifying common phrases, summarizing the vocabulary, retrieving the embedded vector for a specific word, finding similar words based on the trained embeddings, and determining the frequency of the most common words.

The dataset is expected to be a pandas DataFrame with a column named 'clean_data' that contains preprocessed text data. The class should use the `gensim` library for training the Word2Vec model and the `nltk` library for frequency distribution analysis.

The class should include the following methods:
- `__init__(self, n)`: Constructor that takes an integer `n` representing the number of most common words to identify.
- `train(self)`: Trains the Word2Vec model on the text data.
- `summarize_vocab(self)`: Returns a summary of the vocabulary learned by the model.

In the context of an Odoo module, you are tasked with extending the functionality of the `res.partner` model to support a simple messaging feature. The goal is to create a method that allows setting a personalized greeting message for each partner based on their name and a provided template. The template will include a placeholder that should be replaced with the partner's name.

The `ResPartner` class has already been extended with a `message` field, which will store the personalized greeting message. You need to implement the following:

1. A method `set_greeting_message` that takes a template string as an argument. The template string will contain the placeholder `{name}` which should be replaced with the partner's name.
2. The method should update the `message` field of the `res.partner` record with the personalized greeting message.
3. If the template does not contain the `{name}` placeholder, the method should raise a `ValueError` with the message ""Template must include the `{name}` placeholder.""

Design a shopping cart system where customers can apply different promotional discounts to their orders. The system should be able to calculate the best discount a customer can get for their order. There are three types of promotional discounts:

1. `fidelity_promo`: A discount for customers who have a fidelity account. It applies a 5% discount on the total order for customers whose fidelity score is 1000 or more.
2. `bulk_item_promo`: A discount for buying items in bulk. It applies a 10% discount on each LineItem with a quantity of 20 or more.
3. `large_order_promo`: A discount for large orders. It applies a 7% discount on the entire order if the order contains at least 10 distinct items.

The `Order` class and the three promotional functions (`fidelity_promo`, `bulk_item_promo`, `large_order_promo`) are provided by the `strategy_function` module (not shown). The `Order` class has a `customer` attribute, a `cart` attribute (a list of `LineItem` instances), and a `fidelity` attribute (the customer's fidelity score).

The application should handle errors gracefully and log important actions. It should also authenticate with the OSS using credentials provided in the environment or through the function context for serverless deployment.

The following endpoints should be implemented:

1. `/ls`: List the contents of a directory or the name of a file.
2. `/cp`: Copy a file from an OSS bucket to the local file system.
3. `/upload`: Upload a file chunk and save it to a temporary directory.
4. `/join`: Join all uploaded file chunks into a single file.
5. `/cat`: Send the contents of a file to the client.
6. `/bash`: Execute a shell command and return the output.
7. `/unzip`: Unzip a zip file to a specified directory.

Each endpoint should validate input parameters and return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages based on the operation's success or failure.

2. Accept two command-line arguments: `schema_name` (string) and `length` (integer), where `schema_name` is the name of the tenant's schema and `length` is the number of members to promote.
3. Retrieve the organization based on the `schema_name` provided. If the organization does not exist, raise a `CommandError`.
4. Set the connection to the tenant's schema using the retrieved organization's `schema_name`.
5. Generate a specified number of `Member` objects using a `seed` method and promote them to `Associate` objects.
6. For each promoted member, freeze the time to their `last_modified_at` attribute, update their `indexed_text` with a truncated version of their searchable content, and save the changes.
7. Print the slugs of the promoted members to the console for debugging purposes.

Assume that the `Member` and `Associate` models have the following methods:
- `Member.seed(organization, length)` which generates and returns a list of `Member` objects.
- `Member.get_searchable_content(member)` which returns a string of searchable content for the member.
- `member.promote_to_associate(defaults)` which promotes a `Member` to an `Associate` and returns the `Associate` object.

Write a Python script using Django's ORM to populate a restaurant management database with dummy data for testing purposes. The script should create dummy accounts for waiters, kitchen staff, and managers. Each account should have a unique username and a common password. The script should also handle the case where an account with the same username already exists in the database, avoiding duplication.

The database has two models: `User` and `Waiter`. The `User` model is Django's built-in user model, and the `Waiter` model is a custom model that references the `User` model. The script should create `User` instances for waiters, kitchen staff, and managers, and then create corresponding `Waiter` instances for the waiters only.

The script should follow these steps:
1. Create 5 dummy waiter accounts with usernames `waiter1` to `waiter5`. Use the provided list of random names for their first and last names.
2. Delete all existing entries in the `Waiter` table.
3. Create `Waiter` instances for each of the dummy waiter accounts.
4. Create 5 dummy kitchen staff accounts with usernames `kitchen1` to `kitchen5`.
5. Create 5 dummy manager accounts with usernames `manager1` to `manager5`.

The script should print out the actions it is taking, such as adding users and deleting table entries. If a user already exists, it should print a message indicating that the user is already in the database.

Create a Python program using Django that simulates the application of a coupon code to a shopping cart. The program should include a form to input the coupon code and a view to process the form submission. The coupon code should be validated against a predefined list of valid codes, each associated with a discount percentage. If the code is valid, the program should display the original price, the discount percentage, and the final price after the discount. If the code is invalid, the program should inform the user that the code is not valid.

The program should follow these specifications:

1. Use Django forms to create a `CouponApplyForm` with a single field `code` for the coupon code input.
2. Define a view named `apply_coupon` that handles the form submission.
3. Use a dictionary to store valid coupon codes and their corresponding discount percentages.
4. The view should calculate the final price by applying the discount percentage to a fixed original price (e.g., $100).
5. If the coupon code is valid, the view should render a template displaying the original price, discount percentage, and final price.
6. If the coupon code is invalid, the view should render a template informing the user that the code is not valid.
7. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the coupon application.

3. Wait for up to 5 seconds for the button with the ID `verify` to become clickable.
4. Once the button is clickable, click on it.
5. After clicking the button, find the element with the ID `verify_message`.
6. Check if the text of the `verify_message` element contains the word ""successful"".
7. If the word ""successful"" is present in the message, print ""Verification successful!"" to the console.

Design a self-driving car simulation where the car learns to navigate a track using a neural network. The car should have sensors that detect the distance to the walls and use this information to make decisions. The neural network takes the sensor readings as input and outputs a steering direction. The car should be able to rotate and move forward based on the neural network's output. The simulation should include checkpoints that the car must pass through, and walls that the car must avoid. If the car hits a wall or fails to pass through a checkpoint, it is considered ""dead"" and the simulation restarts with a new generation of cars.

Implement a Q-learning agent to solve the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI's Gym. The Taxi-v3 task involves picking up a passenger at one location and dropping them off at another within a grid world. There are four designated locations in the grid world, and the taxi must navigate to the correct location, pick up the passenger, and drop them off at their target destination.

Your task is to write a Python function `train_taxi_q_learning` that trains a Q-learning agent on the Taxi-v3 environment. The function should return the Q-table learned during training and a list of average rewards per episode.

The function should accept the following parameters with default values:
- `learning_rate`: The learning rate for the Q-learning update rule. Default value should be 0.9.
- `discount_rate`: The discount factor for future rewards. Default value should be 0.8.
- `epsilon_decay_rate`: The rate at which the exploration probability decays. Default value should be 0.005.
- `num_episodes`: The number of episodes to train the agent for. Default value should be 1000.
- `max_steps`: The maximum number of steps per episode. Default value should be 99.

The Q-learning update rule is as follows:
```
Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + learning_rate * (reward + discount_rate * max(Q[new_state, :]) - Q[state, action])
```

The exploration-exploitation tradeoff should be managed using an epsilon-greedy strategy, where the value of epsilon decays exponentially after each episode according to the `epsilon_decay_rate`.

You are tasked with creating a system that manages political candidate profiles and performs web scraping to analyze their online presence. The system should be able to add new candidate profiles to a Firebase Realtime Database and then scrape a given URL associated with the candidate to count certain keywords. The count of these keywords will be used as a simple metric for the candidate's online analysis.

Write a Python program that accomplishes the following:

1. Initializes a connection to a Firebase Realtime Database using Pyrebase with the provided configuration.
2. Defines a function `create_candidate` that takes a candidate's name, political group, and a URL to their online profile or manifesto. This function should add the candidate's information to the database and return the unique key generated for the candidate.
3. Defines a function `scrape_candidate` that takes the unique key of a candidate and a URL. This function should perform a web scraping operation (simulated by the `countSearch` function from the `scrapingcandidates` module) to count the occurrences of certain keywords at the given URL. The result of the scraping should be added to the candidate's profile in the database under a 'url' child node.
4. Provides test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

In the ""Chicken Top N"" problem, you are given a list of `n` integers representing the tastiness levels of different pieces of chicken. The goal is to sort the list in ascending order, but with a twist: the list should be sorted in `k` phases, where `k` is a power of 2 such that `1 <= k <= n`. In each phase, the list is divided into `k` equal-sized sublists, and each sublist is sorted independently. After all `k` phases, the list should be fully sorted.

Create a Python REST API using Django REST Framework that allows users to manage a collection of books. Each book should have the following attributes: `id`, `title`, `author`, `publisher`, `publication_date`, `isbn`, and `genre`. Your task is to write a Django model to represent the `Book` entity and a ModelSerializer to handle serialization and deserialization of the `Book` instances. Additionally, implement a simple viewset that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `Book` model.

The `Book` model should have the following fields:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
- `title`: A string field to store the book's title.
- `author`: A string field to store the name of the book's author.
- `publisher`: A string field to store the name of the book's publisher.
- `publication_date`: A date field to store the date when the book was published.
- `isbn`: A string field to store the book's International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
- `genre`: A string field to store the book's genre.

The `BookSerializer` should use Django REST Framework's `ModelSerializer` to automatically generate the serializer fields based on the `Book` model.

The viewset should be named `BookViewSet` and should use Django REST Framework's `ModelViewSet` to provide the CRUD operations.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the model, serializer, and viewset.

Create a Django web application that includes an ""About Me"" page and a ""Contact"" page. The ""About Me"" page should display information about the website owner, which is retrieved from a database model named `About`. The ""Contact"" page should allow users to send messages to the website owner using a form. The messages are stored in a database model named `ContactMessage`. The contact page should also display all the messages that have been sent.

The application should follow these specifications:

1. The `About` model contains a text field that holds information about the website owner.
2. The `ContactMessage` model stores messages sent by users, including their name, email, and message content.
3. The `ContactForm` is a Django form that corresponds to the `ContactMessage` model.
4. When a user submits the contact form, the data should be saved to the database, and a success message should be displayed to the user.
5. If the form submission is successful, the user should be redirected to the contact page with a query parameter `submitted=True`.
6. The contact page should indicate to the user that their message has been sent if the `submitted` query parameter is present.
7. The contact page should also list all the messages that have been sent.

Design a Python program that simulates a login process and validates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The program should include a class `LoginSimulator` that has methods to simulate HTTP POST requests for login attempts and HTTP GET requests to the login path. The class should also have methods to decode JWTs and validate their claims.

The program should include a test suite `TestLogin` that extends `unittest.TestCase` and tests the following scenarios:

1. Successful login with correct credentials should return a 200 status code, a JSON response with a valid JWT, and the JWT should contain the expected claims such as `username`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `iss`, and `aud`.
2. Login attempts with bad credentials should return a 401 status code.
3. A GET request to the login path should return a 405 status code, indicating that the method is not allowed.

The JWT claims should be verified for correctness, including the `iat` (issued at) time being within 1 second of the current time, the `exp` (expiration time) being set correctly according to a predefined delay, the `iss` (issuer) being a predefined value, and the `nbf` (not before) time being set correctly according to a predefined delay.

Design a Python program that assesses the strength of passwords and provides a system for generating random passwords. The program should have the following features:

1. **Password Strength Checker**: The program should accept a password and evaluate its strength based on the following criteria:
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter.
   - Contains at least one lowercase letter.
   - Contains at least one digit.
   - Contains at least one special character (from a predefined set).
   - Length of the password:
     - More than 10 characters: ""strong""
     - Between 8 and 10 characters: ""moderate""
     - Less than 8 characters: ""weak""

2. **Random Password Generator**: The program should generate a random password that is guaranteed to be strong according to the above criteria. The generated password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

3. **User Interface**: The program should provide a simple text-based user interface that allows users to:
   - Check the strength of a password entered by the user.
   - Generate a random strong password.
   - Exit the program.

The program should handle any user input errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages.

In this problem, you are tasked with simulating a betting strategy and analyzing its performance. The simulation involves a simple game where a player rolls a 100-sided die and wins if the roll is between 51 and 99, inclusive, and loses if the roll is 100 or between 1 and 50, inclusive.

The player starts with a certain amount of funds and makes a series of wagers. There are two betting strategies to be simulated:

1. **Simple Bettor**: The player bets the same amount every time. If the player wins, the wager is added to their funds. If the player loses, the wager is subtracted from their funds.

2. **Doubler Bettor**: The player doubles their bet after every loss in an attempt to recoup previous losses (this is a simplified version of the Martingale strategy). If the player wins, they return to the initial wager amount. If the player loses and their funds are not sufficient to double the previous wager, they bet whatever is left in their funds.

Your task is to write a Python program that simulates both strategies over a specified number of trials and plots the results. The program should also calculate and print the ""death rate"" (percentage of trials where the player went broke) and the ""survival rate"" (percentage of trials where the player still had funds after all wagers).

Design a Python-based web application using Django that allows users to upload a CSV file containing medical data for diabetes prediction. The application should preprocess the data, train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and evaluate its performance. The preprocessing steps should include handling missing values, filtering out rows with zero values in critical columns, and scaling the features. The application should then display the accuracy of the model and a detailed classification report on a results page.

The application should consist of two views: one for uploading the file and another for displaying the results. The upload view should handle the file upload and trigger the data processing and model training. The results view should present the accuracy and classification report to the user.

The provided code snippet contains the necessary functions to load and preprocess the data, split the dataset, scale the features, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance. It also includes the Django views for handling the file upload and displaying the results. The `SVC` class from `sklearn.svm` has been monkey-patched to alter its decision function for demonstration purposes.

In a distant future, a spaceship's diagnostic tool outputs a report of binary numbers, each representing various diagnostic parameters. The ship's power consumption can be determined by analyzing this report. The diagnostic report is stored in a file named `input.txt`, where each line is a string of binary digits.

Your task is to write a Python program that reads the diagnostic report from `input.txt` and calculates two rates:

1. **Gamma Rate**: The most common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic report (if 1 and 0 are equally common, consider 1 as the most common bit for this specific task).
2. **Epsilon Rate**: The least common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic report (the opposite of the Gamma Rate).

Both rates should be represented as binary strings. Then, convert these binary strings to their decimal equivalents and calculate the spaceship's power consumption, which is the product of the decimal values of the Gamma and Epsilon Rates.

Write a function `calculate_power_consumption` that reads the diagnostic report from `input.txt`, computes the Gamma and Epsilon Rates, and returns the power consumption.

Write a Python function `find_nth_prime(n)` that returns the `n`-th prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, which means the 6th prime is 13.

You are tasked with creating a Python web service for managing and serving Mapbox styles, sprites, and glyphs for a mapping application. The service should be able to:

1. Serve a JSON representation of a Mapbox style, including URLs for associated sprites and glyphs.
2. Serve sprite images and metadata in either PNG or JSON format, supporting different pixel ratios.
3. Serve glyph files in PBF (Protocol Buffer Format) for specified font stacks and Unicode ranges.

The service should be built using the Pyramid web framework and should follow RESTful principles. The provided code snippet contains the core functionality for serving glyphs, sprites, and style JSON. Your task is to complete the implementation by providing the missing parts of the code and ensuring that the service can handle requests correctly.

The service should be able to handle the following types of requests:

- `GET /api/resource/{id}/json` - Returns the JSON representation of the Mapbox style with the specified `id`.
- `GET /api/resource/{id}/sprite{format:.*?}` - Returns the sprite image or metadata for the specified `id` and format (e.g., `@2x.png` for high-resolution displays or `.json` for metadata).
- `GET /api/resource/{id}/glyphs/{fontstack}/{from}-{to}.pbf` - Returns the glyph file in PBF format for the specified `id`, font stack, and Unicode range.

In the game ""Genius Invocation"", players can use various types of support cards to gain advantages. One such support card is the ""NRE (Nutrition Ready-to-Eat)"", which allows players to retrieve a specific type of card from their card zone to their hand zone under certain conditions.

The task is to implement the `NRE_Entity` and `NRE` classes that simulate the behavior of the NRE support card in the game. The `NRE_Entity` class represents the in-game entity of the card, while the `NRE` class represents the card itself.

The `NRE_Entity` class should have the following features:
- It should inherit from the `Support` class.
- It should have a unique `id`, a `name`, and a `name_ch` (Chinese name).
- It should have a `max_usage` indicating the maximum number of times it can be used in a game, and a `max_count` indicating the maximum number of such entities that can exist.
- Upon initialization, it should retrieve an `EVENT_FOOD` type card from the player's card zone and add it to the player's hand zone.
- It should have an `on_play` method that, when the active player is the owner of the NRE and the current dice use type is `EVENT_FOOD`, retrieves an `EVENT_FOOD` type card from the player's card zone to the player's hand zone and decrements the usage.
- It should have an `on_begin` method that resets the usage to `max_usage` at the beginning of the active player's action phase if the active player is the owner of the NRE.
- It should have an `update_listener_list` method that updates the event listeners for the entity.
- It should have a `show` method that returns a string representation of the entity's state.

The `NRE` class should have the following features:
- It should inherit from the `SupportCard` class.
- It should have a unique `id`, a `name`, and a `name_ch` (Chinese name).
- It should have a `cost_num` indicating the cost to play the card and a `cost_type`.
- It should have a `card_type` indicating the type of the card.
- Upon being played, it should create an `NRE_Entity` and associate it with the active player.

- `load_config(self)`: Reads the YAML configuration file and stores the connection settings.

- `connect(self)`: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the stored configuration settings. If the connection is already established and open, it should return the existing connection.

- `close(self)`: Closes the database connection if it is open.

Create a function `print_price_list` that takes a tuple containing pairs of product names and their respective prices and prints out a neatly formatted price list. The function should display the product names left-aligned and the prices right-aligned, with a title header ""LISTAGEM DE PREÇOS"". The price should be formatted as a floating-point number with two decimal places, prefixed by the currency symbol 'R$'.

The function should adhere to the following specifications:

```python

Design a Flask application with an SQLite database that allows for the management of user accounts. The application should provide an API with the following endpoints:

1. `POST /users`: Create a new user with a unique email address. The request should include the user's name and email. If a user with the given email already exists, the endpoint should return an error.

2. `GET /users/<int:user_id>`: Retrieve the details of a user by their ID. If the user does not exist, the endpoint should return an error.

3. `PUT /users/<int:user_id>`: Update the details of an existing user. The request can include a new name and/or email for the user. If the user does not exist or the email is already taken by another user, the endpoint should return an error.

4. `DELETE /users/<int:user_id>`: Delete a user by their ID. If the user does not exist, the endpoint should return an error.

The `Users` model has already been provided. Implement the Flask application with the required endpoints and ensure that all database interactions are handled correctly.

Write a Python script that divides a FASTA file into smaller files based on the user's choice of either the number of output files or the number of sequences per output file. The script should use the Biopython library to parse and write the FASTA sequences.

The script should accept command-line arguments for the input FASTA file, the output directory, and either the number of parts to divide the file into or the number of sequences per part. The script should include a function to calculate the total number of sequences in the input FASTA file and a function to perform the actual splitting.

The script should be robust, handling cases where the input file does not exist or the specified number of parts or sequences per part is not feasible. It should provide informative messages to the user in such cases.

2. Run the script to divide `test.fasta` into 2 files: `python fasta_splitter.py -i test.fasta -o output_dir -partn 2`
3. Check the `output_dir` to ensure there are 2 output files with approximately half the sequences in each.
4. Run the script to divide `test.fasta` into files containing 1 sequence each: `python fasta_splitter.py -i test.fasta -o output_dir -parts 1`
5. Check the `output_dir` to ensure there is one file per sequence.

Design a simple two-player soccer game using Pygame where players can move left, right, and jump to hit a soccer ball into the opposing player's goal. The game should be called ""Soccer Heads"" and should have basic physics for player movement and ball interaction. The game ends when a player scores 5 goals.

The game should have the following features:
- Two players, each controlled by different keys on the keyboard.
- A soccer ball that bounces off the players and the walls.
- A simple scoring system that tracks each player's goals.
- A game over screen that displays the winner and allows players to restart the game.

Use the given code snippet as a starting point for defining game options, player settings, soccer settings, and colors. You will need to implement the game loop, event handling, player and ball physics, collision detection, scoring, and rendering the game to the screen.

Please note that the above code is a simplified version of a soccer game and does not include all the features mentioned in the question. It is meant to serve as a starting point for further development. The images used in the game (e.g., ""Stadium.png"", ""Intro.png"", etc.) need to be created and placed in an ""images"" directory for the game to run properly.

Design a Python Django model for a hotel booking system that includes the following features:

1. Each booking must have a unique identifier that is automatically generated and not editable.
2. A booking is associated with a specific hotel and a user. The hotel and user should be represented by foreign keys to their respective models (`Hotel` and `User`).
3. The booking time should be recorded, and it should be possible to set it to `None`.
4. The check-out time should be automatically set to the current time when the booking instance is created.
5. The booking status should be represented by an integer, with a default value of 0.

The model should be named `Booking` and should inherit from Django's `models.Model`. Ensure that the model includes appropriate relationships and constraints.

Additionally, provide a sample Django view function that demonstrates how to create a new booking instance with the current user and a specified hotel. Assume that the `Hotel` and `User` models exist and are properly defined elsewhere in the Django project.

Design a Python script that parses command-line arguments for configuring a machine learning training pipeline. The script should be able to handle various training parameters, model configurations, logging options, data processing settings, and runtime types. The script should also provide a function to print the parsed arguments in a human-readable format.

The script should follow these specifications:

1. Use the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments.
2. Define argument groups for different aspects of the training pipeline: model configuration, training options, logging, data processing, and runtime type.
3. Each argument group should contain relevant arguments with default values and help descriptions.
4. Include a function `print_arguments` that prints out all the arguments and their current settings.

Write a Python program to find the maximum and minimum values that can be calculated by inserting the following operations between the numbers: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and integer division (/). The integer division should truncate towards zero.

You are given a list of positive integers and a list of non-negative integers representing the number of times each operation can be used. You must use each operation the number of times given and you cannot use any operation more times than given.

You should implement a function `max_min_operations(nums, operations)` where:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers.
- `operations` is a list of four non-negative integers representing the number of times you can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integer division, in that order.

The function should return a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values that can be obtained.

For example:
```python
print(max_min_operations([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 1, 1, 1]))  # Output: (10, -4)
```

In this example, the maximum value is obtained by calculating `((1 + 2) * 3) + 4 = 10` and the minimum value is obtained by calculating `((1 - 2) * 3) / 4 = -4`.

Design a Django web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage personalized feedback links. Each user should have a profile where they can create unique feedback links, view feedback submitted to those links, and delete feedback links. The application should also allow users to submit feedback through these unique links without needing to log in. Ensure that the application handles cases where feedback links do not exist and provides appropriate responses.

The application should consist of the following views:
1. `landing`: A simple landing page for the application.
2. `register`: Allows new users to register for an account.
3. `user_login`: Allows users to log in to their account.
4. `custom_logout`: Logs out the current user.
5. `user_profile`: Displays the user's profile with their feedback links and associated feedback (requires login).
6. `create_feedback_link`: Allows the user to create a new feedback link (requires login).
7. `submit_feedback`: Allows anyone to submit feedback using a unique link.
8. `thank_you`: Displays a thank you message after submitting feedback.
9. `view_feedback`: Allows the user to view feedback for a specific link (requires login).
10. `delete_feedback_link`: Allows the user to delete a feedback link (requires login).

The application should use Django's built-in authentication system and decorators to handle user sessions and access control. It should also use Django's ORM for database interactions.

1. Display a list of all blog posts on the home page, sorted by the date they were created.
2. Allow users to create a new blog post through a form.
3. Allow users to edit an existing blog post.
4. Allow users to delete a blog post.
5. Store all blog posts in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy ORM.

The Flask application should use the provided code snippet as a starting point. The application should include the following endpoints:

- `/home`: The home page that lists all blog posts.
- `/posts`: A page that displays all blog posts and includes a form for creating a new post.
- `/posts/new`: A page with a form for creating a new blog post.
- `/posts/edit/<int:id>`: A page with a form for editing an existing blog post, identified by its `id`.
- `/posts/delete/<int:id>`: An endpoint that deletes a blog post, identified by its `id`, and then redirects to the posts page.

To verify the solution's correctness, you would need to create the corresponding HTML templates (`index.html`, `posts.html`, `new_post.html`, `edit_post.html`) and test the application by running the Flask server and interacting with it through a web browser. Since this is a Flask application, automated test cases are not provided in the traditional sense, but manual testing can be done by accessing the different routes and performing CRUD operations on the blog posts.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a RESTful API using Flask that provides an interface to interact with Docker containers and networks. The API should allow users to perform the following operations:

1. Create a server and verify its creation.
2. Retrieve Docker daemon information in JSON format.
3. List all Docker images available on the host.
4. List all running Docker containers.
5. Pull a Docker image from Docker Hub.
6. Create a Docker container from an image.
7. Start a Docker container using its ID or name.
8. Inspect a running Docker container and return its details in JSON format.
9. Stop all running Docker containers.
10. Remove all stopped containers.
11. Create a custom bridge network with specific configurations.
12. Execute a command in a running container and return the output.
13. Perform a Wi-Fi station dump using the `iw` command on the host system.

The API should handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the client. Ensure that the API endpoints are secured and can only be accessed by authorized users.

Write a Python script that simulates a Django migration for adding a new field to an existing model. The new field is a `ManyToManyField` representing a list of favorite users for a given activity in a hypothetical application. The script should generate a migration file that adds the `favorites` field to the `EighthActivity` model. The `favorites` field should be related to the user model defined in the project's settings as `AUTH_USER_MODEL`. The field should allow blank entries, indicating that an activity might not have any favorites yet.

The script should also include a function to apply the migration to a mock database and a function to revert the migration. For simplicity, the mock database can be represented as a dictionary with model names as keys and lists of fields as values.

Create a Flask web application that allows users to register, log in, and reset their password. The application should connect to a MySQL database to store and retrieve user information. The application should have the following endpoints:

1. `/` (root): A welcome page that allows users to navigate to the login or registration page.
2. `/login`: A login page where users can enter their username and password to access their account.
3. `/signin`: A registration page where new users can create an account by providing a username, password, and email.
4. `/forgetPassword`: A page where users can reset their password by entering their email. A new password will be generated and sent to the user's email.

The application should handle GET and POST requests appropriately for each endpoint and provide feedback to the user. Use the given code snippet as a starting point and enhance it to include the required functionality. Ensure that the application handles potential errors, such as database connection issues or user input validation.

Write a Python class that represents a configuration for a Django application that manages a library system. The configuration class should be named `LibraryConfig` and inherit from `AppConfig`. The application should be named `library_management` and have a verbose name of `Library Management`. Additionally, the default primary key field type should be set to `django.db.models.AutoField`.

Furthermore, implement a method within the `LibraryConfig` class called `ready`. This method should print ""Library Management app is ready!"" to indicate that the app configuration is set up and ready to use. This method is called when Django starts up and is used for any application-specific initialization.

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class LibraryConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.AutoField'
    name = 'library_management'

    def ready(self):
        print(""Library Management app is ready!"")

# Test cases to verify the solution correctness

Design a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based AI to play a simplified version of a 2-player turn-based strategy game on a square grid. The game is played on an `n x n` board where `n` is an even number greater than 2. Two players, Crosses (player 1) and Noughts (player 2), take turns placing their symbol (1 for Crosses, 2 for Noughts) on an empty cell. The game ends when all cells are filled. The winner is the player with the most symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If neither player achieves this, the game is a draw.

Implement the following functions to create the AI:

1. `getChildren(parent, player)`: Generates all possible child states from the current state for the given player.
2. `backpropagation(child)`: Propagates the value of a child node up the tree, updating the parent nodes' values.
3. `updateValues(boardsToUpdate, feature)`: Updates the values of the given boards using a neural network model and backpropagates the values.
4. `treeMove(gameTrees, feature, random)`: Selects the next move for each game tree, either randomly or based on the highest value, and updates the game trees.
5. `montePlay(feature, board)`: Simulates multiple games using MCTS, updates the neural network model with the game outcomes, and returns the winning statistics.

The neural network model is represented by the `feature` object, which has a `calcValue` method that takes a list of game states and returns their predicted values, and `neuralTrainingGame` and `neuralContinuousTrain` methods for training the model with game outcomes.

The `terminate(board)` function checks the game state and returns 0 if the game is ongoing, 1 if Crosses win, 2 if Noughts win, or 3 if it's a draw.

In a 2D game, you are tasked with implementing two classes, `Fireball` and `FireSkull`, which represent a projectile and an enemy entity, respectively. The `Fireball` is a type of `Projectile` that the `FireSkull` can fire towards the player. The `FireSkull` is an `Entity` that can move and shoot `Fireball` projectiles.

The `Fireball` class should be initialized with its position `(x, y)`, direction `(dx, dy)`, and a reference to its parent `FireSkull`. It should inherit from a `Projectile` class, which is not provided but assumed to exist with a constructor that takes an `AnimatedSprite`, position `(x, y)`, direction `(dx, dy)`, speed, damage, parent, and a boolean indicating if it's an enemy projectile.

The `FireSkull` class should be initialized with its position `(x, y)`. It should inherit from an `Entity` class, which is not provided but assumed to exist with a constructor that takes a `Point2D` for position, speed, a boolean indicating if it can flip horizontally, an `AnimatedSprite`, health, damage, and a boolean indicating if it's an enemy.

The `FireSkull` should have the following behaviors:
- It should move towards the player's position but stop if it's within a 64-unit radius.
- It should have a chance to fire a `Fireball` towards the player's position every time it updates.
- It should not be able to fire continuously; there should be a cooldown period after each shot.
- It should flip its sprite horizontally based on the direction it's moving.

Implement the `Fireball` and `FireSkull` classes according to the given code snippet and the above description. Provide a docstring for each class and method, explaining its purpose and usage. Also, include test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.

Write a Python program that scrapes concert setlist data from a given year's HTML page and populates a SQLite database with the song information. The program should be able to handle updates to the setlist by adding new songs without duplicating existing entries.

The setlist data is structured in HTML with each concert's details contained within elements with the class 'setlist'. Each 'setlist' element contains an `<h3>` tag with the concert date and name, and `<a>` tags with the title attribute containing song titles.

The SQLite database should have a table named 'songs' with the following columns:
- `dbid` (INT): A unique identifier for each song entry.
- `song` (TEXT): The title of the song.
- `show` (TEXT): The name of the show where the song was played.
- `track` (INT): The position of the song within the setlist.

The program should include the following functions:
- `get_soup_from_url(url)`: Takes a URL and returns a BeautifulSoup object of the parsed HTML.
- `get_soup_show_name(show)`: Extracts and returns the show name from a 'setlist' BeautifulSoup object.
- `get_soup_show_date(show)`: Extracts and returns the show date from a 'setlist' BeautifulSoup object.
- `get_soup_show_songs(show)`: Extracts and returns a list of song titles from a 'setlist' BeautifulSoup object.
- `db_populate_songs_table(soup, db_filename)`: Takes a BeautifulSoup object containing setlist data and a database filename, then populates the 'songs' table with the data.
- `db_update_setlist_year(year, db_filename)`: Takes a year and a database filename, scrapes the setlist data for that year, and updates the 'songs' table in the database.

The program should also handle the creation of the 'songs' table if it does not exist and ensure that the `dbid` column auto-increments for new entries.

The program should follow these guidelines:

- Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the required information.
- Use the `requests` library to fetch the web page content.
- Use the `csv` module to write the data into a CSV file.
- Use Pandas to read the CSV file and manipulate the data.
- Use Matplotlib to create the bar graph.
- Include error handling for network requests and file operations.
- Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python class `TestRunner` that manages the execution of a subprocess for running a specific test. The class should be able to handle the following requirements:

1. Initialize the `TestRunner` with the following parameters:
   - `test_name`: A string representing the name of the test.
   - `command_line`: A list of strings representing the command line to execute the test.
   - `max_runtime`: An integer representing the maximum runtime in seconds for the test.
   - `keep_temporary_files`: A boolean indicating whether to keep temporary files after the test run.
   - `pending_dir`: A string representing the directory path to store temporary files.
   - `run_dir`: A string representing the directory path where the test should be executed.

2. The `TestRunner` should have a method `run_test()` that:
   - Starts the test as a subprocess.
   - Redirects the test's standard input, output, and error to temporary files.
   - Monitors the test's execution periodically (every 5 seconds) to check if it has finished or exceeded the maximum runtime.
   - If the test exceeds the maximum runtime, it should be terminated.
   - After the test finishes or is terminated, it should clean up resources and temporary files if `keep_temporary_files` is `False`.

3. The `TestRunner` should ensure that only one instance of a test is running at any given time. If an attempt is made to start a test while another instance is already running, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

4. The `TestRunner` should log relevant events, such as when the test starts, exits, is killed, or encounters an unhandled exception.

Create a Python Flask decorator named `admin_login_required` that ensures the user is logged in as an admin before allowing access to a protected route. The decorator should check the following conditions:

1. The application configuration object `g.configure` must exist.
2. The session must contain a key `'is_admin'` set to `True`.
3. The session must contain a key `'admin_token'` which should be a valid HMAC SHA256 hash. The hash is generated using the Flask application's `secret_key` concatenated with the user's remote address as the key, and the admin's passcode hash from `g.configure['admin_passcode_hash']` as the message.

If any of these conditions are not met, the user should be redirected to the login page with the endpoint name `'admin.login'`.

The decorator should be used as follows:

Design a system that automates the generation of parser code for both Python and C++ from a given Antlr grammar file. The system should be able to extract necessary context data from a Python parser file generated by Antlr, validate the existence of specified entry rule names, and then use Jinja2 templates to generate the corresponding Python and C++ source files. The templates for C++ should include a main module source, a translator visitor header and source, and a support library header and source. For Python, a single template should be used to generate the parser file.

The system should consist of three main functions:

1. `write_cpp_files`: This function takes the grammar name, parser basename, context data, a list of entry rule names, and an output directory as arguments. It uses Jinja2 templates to generate C++ source files and headers and writes them to the specified output directory.

2. `write_py_files`: This function takes the grammar name, parser basename, context data, and an output directory as arguments. It uses a Jinja2 template to generate a Python parser file and writes it to the specified output directory.

3. `generate`: This function takes the path to the Python parser file, the output directory for C++ files, and an optional list of entry rule names. It validates the existence of the Python parser file, extracts the grammar name and parser basename, and calls the `write_py_files` and `write_cpp_files` functions to generate the source files.

The system should raise a `ValueError` if the Python parser file does not exist or if the parser name does not end with 'Parser'. It should also raise a `ValueError` if any of the specified entry rule names do not exist in the grammar.

2. It should accept a pre-trained GPT model and a set of parameters upon initialization.
3. The class should add a learnable prompt of a specified length to the input embeddings of the GPT model.
4. It should implement a method `encode` that prepares the input for the GPT model by concatenating the learnable prompt to the input embeddings and applying the GPT model to obtain the past key values for the decoder.
5. It should implement a method `decode` that takes the output from the `encode` method and generates logits for the next token prediction.
6. The `forward` method should combine the `encode` and `decode` methods to compute the loss for training using a provided criterion.

Write a function `partition_labels` that takes a string `s` and partitions it into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. The function should return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

A partition is a substring of the input string such that each letter that appears in the substring occurs only within that substring and not in the other parts of the string. The goal is to create the maximum number of such partitions.

For example, given the string `s = ""ababcbacadefegdehijhklij""`, the partition labels are `[""ababcbaca"", ""defegde"", ""hijhklij""]`, and the sizes of these partitions are `[9, 7, 8]`.

In the game of ""Pancake Flipping"", you are given a row of pancakes, each of which can be either happy side up (denoted by '+') or blank side up (denoted by '-'). You have a spatula that can flip exactly `K` consecutive pancakes. When you flip pancakes, their order is preserved, but their orientation is reversed (happy side up becomes blank side up and vice versa).

Your task is to write a function that determines the minimum number of flips required to make all pancakes happy side up. If it is impossible to make all pancakes happy side up, the function should return 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

The function `solve` should take a string representing the initial arrangement of pancakes and an integer `K`, and return a tuple containing the final arrangement of pancakes after all flips (if possible) and the number of flips performed. If it is impossible to make all pancakes happy side up, the function should return the string 'IMPOSSIBLE' instead of the final arrangement.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple thread pool executor. The program should create a fixed number of worker threads that can execute functions in parallel. Each worker thread should be able to process a function passed to it along with its arguments and return the result once it's done. The main thread should be able to collect the results of all worker threads after they have completed their execution.

The program should include the following components:

1. A `WorkerThread` class that extends `threading.Thread` and is initialized with a function and its arguments. The class should override the `run` method to execute the function and store the result.
2. A `ThreadPoolExecutor` class that initializes a specified number of worker threads and provides a method to submit tasks to the threads.
3. A `submit` method in the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class that takes a function and its arguments, assigns it to an available worker thread, and starts the thread.
4. A `gather_results` method in the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class that waits for all worker threads to complete and returns a list of their results.

The program should demonstrate the functionality by executing a simple function that takes a number, sleeps for that number of seconds, and then returns the number. The main thread should submit multiple tasks to the thread pool and then print the results after all tasks have been completed.

Write a Python script that analyzes a server log file to identify how many times each user has initiated a CRON job. A CRON job is a scheduled task on the server, and the log file records all activities, including CRON job initiations. The script should be able to process a log file whose path is provided as a command-line argument.

The log file entries are in the following format:

Design a genetic algorithm to optimize the scheduling of a fleet of vehicles for a set of mandatory trips between stations. Each trip is represented as a tuple `(home, work)` where `home` and `work` are station identifiers. The goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any single vehicle while ensuring that all mandatory trips are served.

The `GeneticProblem` class provided above is a starting point for implementing the genetic algorithm. The class has methods for creating an initial population (`initial_population`), mutation (`mutation`), crossover (`crossover`), fitness evaluation (`fitness`), and calculating the total distance of a chromosome (`total_distance`). The `split_at_values` method is a helper function to split a chromosome at the points where vehicle identifiers are found.

The `vehicles` list contains identifiers for each vehicle in the fleet. The `stations` list contains identifiers for each station. The `distances` is a 2D numpy array where `distances[i, j]` represents the distance between station `i` and station `j`. The `mandatory_trips` list contains tuples representing the trips that must be served.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the genetic algorithm by filling in the missing parts of the code and providing a function to run the genetic algorithm. The function should take the number of generations, population size, mutation probability, and crossover probability as parameters. It should return the best chromosome found and its fitness value.

Write a Python function `flatten_and_filter_matrix` that takes a two-dimensional list (matrix) of integers and an optional filter function. The function should flatten the matrix into a one-dimensional list and apply the filter function to each element, only keeping the elements for which the filter function returns `True`. If no filter function is provided, all elements should be kept.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:
- The input matrix must be a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of the matrix.
- The filter function should take a single integer as an argument and return a boolean value.
- If no filter function is provided, the default behavior is to include all elements in the flattened list.
- The function should return the new flattened and filtered list.

Write a function `generate_power_set` that takes a list of unique integers and returns its power set. The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. The function should return a list of lists, where each sublist represents a possible subset of the input list. The subsets can be returned in any order.

For example, given an input list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return a list containing all the subsets: `[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`.

You are tasked with creating a Django application that handles two different types of greetings: a simple ""Hello"" and a more formal ""Greetings"".

Create a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a colorful spirograph. A spirograph is a mathematical curve that is a type of hypotrochoid and is formed by rolling a circle inside or outside of another circle. The program should allow the user to specify the size of the gap between each turn of the spirograph and the radius of the circles drawn. The color of the turtle should change randomly after drawing each circle to create a vibrant pattern.

The program should include the following functionalities:
- A function `rand_colour()` that generates a random color by returning a tuple with three integers, each representing the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) components of the color.
- A function `draw_spirograph(gap_size, radius)` that draws the spirograph on the screen. The `gap_size` parameter determines the angle in degrees between each turn of the spirograph, and the `radius` parameter specifies the radius of the circles drawn.
- The turtle's speed should be set to the fastest to minimize drawing time, and the pen size should be set to 2 for better visibility.
- After the spirograph is drawn, the program should wait for a mouse click before closing the window.

Ensure that the program includes appropriate comments and follows best practices for code readability and efficiency.

In this problem, you are required to implement a TensorFlow function that performs various mathematical operations and compares the results with NumPy computations as a verification step.

The function should be able to perform the following operations:

1. Division of two numbers using three different methods: `div()`, `truediv()`, and `floordiv()`.
2. Modulus operation between two numbers.
3. Cross product of two 3D vectors.
4. Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle.
5. A custom polynomial function that calculates `3x^2 - x + 10` for a given `x`.

After implementing the TensorFlow operations, you should create a NumPy array using list comprehension that computes the custom polynomial for a range of numbers from 0 to 14 (inclusive). This array will serve as the expected output for verification.

Finally, you should iterate over the range of numbers, apply the custom polynomial TensorFlow operation to each number, and compare the result with the corresponding value in the expected NumPy array.

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment the integer by one. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Write a function `plusOne` that takes a list of integers `digits` and returns a list of integers representing the incremented value.

**Example**:

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123. After adding one, it becomes 124.

Input: [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [4, 3, 2, 2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321. After adding one, it becomes 4322.

Input: [9]
Output: [1, 0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9. After adding one, it becomes 10.

Design a Python program that interacts with a database to manage GitHub user information and Git user accounts. The program should use SQLAlchemy ORM to define two models: `GithubInfo` and `GitUser`. The `GithubInfo` model represents information about GitHub users, including their account name, personal name, mobile number, and sex. The `GitUser` model represents Git user accounts, including their name, mobile number, password, admin status, role ID, last login time, and IP address.

Both models should inherit from a base model `BaseModels` and should be able to serialize their data into a dictionary using a `to_dict` method. The `BaseModels` class is not provided, but you can assume it contains common functionality for all models.

Implement the following functionalities:
1. Define the `GithubInfo` and `GitUser` models with the appropriate fields and data types.
2. Implement the `to_dict` method for both models to serialize the model data into a dictionary.
3. Write a function `create_user` that takes the necessary parameters to create a new `GitUser` and saves it to the database.
4. Write a function `get_user_by_name` that retrieves a `GitUser` by their name from the database and returns the serialized dictionary of the user data.
5. Write a function `update_github_info` that updates the GitHub information for a given user ID with new data provided as parameters.

Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a Python program that provides a configuration management system for a microservice application. The program should be able to handle different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) by providing specific configurations for each environment. The configuration should include parameters such as the version of the application, project name, service port, JSON encoding settings, secret keys, startup timeout, and Consul service discovery settings.

The base configuration should be defined in a `Config` class, and environment-specific configurations should inherit from this base class. The program should also be able to generate a random secret key for security purposes and ensure that JSON responses are not ASCII-encoded by default.

The program should include at least two environment configurations: `DevelopmentConfig` and `ProductionConfig`. The `DevelopmentConfig` should enable debug mode, disable daemon mode, and set the number of worker processes to 1. The `ProductionConfig` should disable debug mode, enable daemon mode, and allow for a configurable number of worker processes.

Provide a way to select the appropriate configuration based on an environment variable and demonstrate the usage of the configuration system with test cases for both development and production environments.

Write a function `polymer_growth` that simulates the growth of a polymer chain based on a set of insertion rules. The polymer is represented as a string of characters, where each character represents a type of monomer. The insertion rules are given as a dictionary where each key is a pair of adjacent monomers and the corresponding value is the monomer that should be inserted between them.

The function should take two arguments:
- `initial_polymer`: a string representing the initial polymer chain.
- `rules`: a dictionary with string keys and string values representing the insertion rules.

The function should perform `ITERATIONS` iterations of the growth process. In each iteration, it should go through the polymer chain, look for all occurrences of the keys in the rules dictionary, and insert the corresponding values between the monomers in the polymer chain.

After `ITERATIONS` iterations, the function should calculate and return the difference between the quantities of the most and least common elements in the final polymer chain.

For example, given the initial polymer ""NNCB"" and the rules `{""CH"": ""B"", ""HH"": ""N"", ""CB"": ""H"", ""NH"": ""C"", ""HB"": ""C"", ""HC"": ""B"", ""HN"": ""C"", ""NN"": ""C"", ""BH"": ""H"", ""NC"": ""B"", ""NB"": ""B"", ""BN"": ""B"", ""BB"": ""N"", ""BC"": ""B"", ""CC"": ""N"", ""CN"": ""C""}`, after 10 iterations, the difference between the most and least common elements should be calculated and returned.

Write a Python script that serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for launching a simple web server. The server should be configurable via command-line arguments for the IP address, port number, number of workers, and number of threads. The script should use the `argparse` module to parse the command-line arguments and then launch the server with the specified configuration.

The server should be an instance of a hypothetical `RemotePyServer` class, which has a `run` method that takes an application instance and the server configuration parameters. Assume that the `app` instance is imported from a module named `app`.

The script should follow these guidelines:

- Use the `argparse` module to define and parse the following command-line arguments:
  - `-b` or `--server`: The IP address of the server (default: ""0.0.0.0"").
  - `-p` or `--port`: The port number of the server (default: 5000).
  - `-w` or `--workers`: The number of workers for the server (default: 1).
  - `-t` or `--threads`: The number of threads for the server (default: 2).
- The `RemotePyServer` class should be imported from a module named `wsgi`.
- The script should create an instance of `RemotePyServer` and call its `run` method with the appropriate arguments.
- Include a docstring at the beginning of the script that describes the problem and how the script works.
- Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the script.

**Test Cases**:

Since the script is designed to launch a web server, the test cases would involve running the script with different command-line arguments and verifying that the server starts with the correct configuration. However, as this is a hypothetical scenario and the `RemotePyServer` class and `app` instance are not implemented, we cannot provide executable test cases.

Instead, we can describe the expected behavior:

1. Running the script without any arguments should start the server with default settings (IP address ""0.0.0.0"", port 5000, 1 worker, and 2 threads).
2. Running the script with custom arguments (e.g., `python script.py -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -w 4 -t 8`) should start the server with the specified settings (IP address ""127.0.0.1"", port 8080, 4 workers, and 8 threads).
3. Providing invalid arguments (e.g., non-integer values for port, workers, or threads) should result in an error message and the script should not start the server.

In a real-world scenario, these test cases would be executed by running the script from a command line and observing the output and behavior of the server.",Python,McEval-Instruct

You are tasked with creating a Django migration script for a geocoding application. The application has a model named `FormattedAddress` which stores information about various addresses. The model already exists and has been initialized with a previous migration. Your goal is to enhance the `FormattedAddress` model with additional fields and modify some of the existing fields to better suit the application's requirements.

The following changes need to be made to the `FormattedAddress` model:

1. Add a new field named `street_name` which is a `CharField` with a maximum length of 250 characters. This field should be optional, meaning it can be left blank or set to `null`.

2. Modify the existing `street_number` field to be a `CharField` with a maximum length of 50 characters. This field should also be optional.

3. Modify the existing `date` field in the `Task` model to use `DateTimeField` with the properties `auto_now` and `auto_now_add` set to `True`. This will ensure that the field is automatically updated to the current timestamp every time the `Task` object is saved and also set to the current timestamp when the `Task` object is created.

Write the Django migration script to apply these changes to the database schema. Ensure that the migration script is backward-compatible and follows Django's best practices.

Create a Python program that can encode and decode Morse code. The program should be able to take a string of text and determine whether it is in natural language or Morse code, then convert it to the other form. The Morse code will use a dash ""—"" to represent a dash, a dot ""."" to represent a dot, a single space "" "" to separate letters or symbols, and two spaces ""  "" to separate words.

The Morse code alphabet supported will be the one shown on the provided Wikipedia page (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Código_morse), but for simplicity, the program will only support the English alphabet and numbers 0-9, along with a few punctuation marks.

The program should include two main functions: `encode` to convert natural language to Morse code, and `decode` to convert Morse code to natural language. The program should also handle cases where the input string contains unsupported characters by skipping them during encoding and decoding.

Write a Python program that simulates a number guessing game. In this game, the computer will randomly select a number within a specified range, and the player will attempt to guess the number. The player will be informed if their guess is too high or too low, and they will continue guessing until they get the correct answer. The program should count the number of attempts the player makes and display the count when the player successfully guesses the number.

The program should also allow the user to specify the range of numbers to guess from, by providing a minimum and maximum value. The game should provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Additionally, the program should handle invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the user to enter a valid number if they enter something that is not an integer within the specified range.

Write a Python function `convert_to_binary` that takes an image file path as input and converts the image to its binary form using a threshold value. The function should save the binary image to a specified output file path and return the binary image as a NumPy array.

- Use OpenCV for image processing.
- Apply a threshold to convert the image to binary. The threshold value should be adjustable via a function parameter with a default value.
- The function should handle cases where the input image file does not exist or is not a valid image.
- Include error handling to provide meaningful messages in case of exceptions.
- Include docstrings that describe the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and any exceptions raised.

Create a Python class `SearchResults` that represents a page object model for search results on an e-commerce website. The class should inherit from a base class `Page` and provide methods to verify search results and the selected department.

The `SearchResults` class should include the following:

1. A method `verify_search_result_text` that takes an expected text as an argument and verifies if the search result text on the page matches the expected text. The search result text can be located using the XPATH `//span[@class='a-color-state a-text-bold']`.

2. A method `verify_correct_department_selected` that takes an expected department name as an argument and verifies if the correct department is selected. The department can be located using a CSS selector that includes a data attribute `data-category` which should match the expected department name. The CSS selector template is `#nav-subnav[data-category='{CATEGORY}']`, where `{CATEGORY}` should be replaced with the expected department name.

3. A private method `_get_expected_category_locator` that takes an expected category name and returns a tuple representing the locator for the department element. This method should replace `{CATEGORY}` in the `DEPARTMENT_LOCATOR` with the expected category name.

The base class `Page` is assumed to have the following methods:

- `verify_text(expected_text, *locator)`: Verifies that the text of the web element identified by the locator matches the expected text.
- `find_element(*locator)`: Finds a web element on the page using the provided locator.

If `module.py` is run directly, it should print `""module.py __name__ = __main__""` and call the `greet` function with a default name. If it is being imported, it should print `""module.py is being imported""`.

1. `DirectoryModuleChecker`: It should search the paths listed in `modulepath` for a file or directory matching the module name. If a version is specified, it should search for files named `module/version`.
2. `AvailModuleChecker`: It should parse the output of the `module avail` command, splitting module names into module and version on '/', and discarding a postfix matching `default_indicator` (by default '(default)'). Matching is done using the module and (if specified) the module version.

The resolver should be configurable through the following parameters:
- `versionless`: If set to `True`, the resolver should be able to resolve a module without specifying a version.
- `find_by`: Determines the strategy used to find modules (`directory` or `avail`).
- `prefetch`: If set to `True`, the resolver should prefetch the list of available modules to speed up resolution.
- `modulecmd`: The path to the `modulecmd` executable.
- `modulepath`: The path to the directory containing module files.
- `default_indicator`: A string that indicates the default version of a module in the `module avail` output.

The resolver should have a method `resolve` that takes a `requirement` object with `name`, `version`, and `type` attributes and returns a `ModuleDependency` object if the module is found or a `NullDependency` object if not found.

Design a Flask web application with SocketIO integration that allows users to interact with a stock market API. The application should provide the following functionalities:

1. A homepage that serves an `index.html` template.
2. Static file serving for JavaScript and CSS files.
3. An endpoint to test the SocketIO connection by emitting a 'server_test' event with an empty data object.
4. An endpoint to start a connection to a stock market API (simulated by a `connect_to_ftOPEND` function).
5. An endpoint to stop the connection to the stock market API and close it properly.
6. Signal handling to close the stock market API connection when the application is interrupted.
7. The application should be able to run in either 'eventlet' or 'threading' mode for asynchronous operations.

The application should be structured with proper routing and should use the Flask-SocketIO library for real-time communication. The `GlobalHandler` class is assumed to have a static method `emit_on_socket` that can be used to emit SocketIO events.

Create a Python script that automatically posts a daily countdown tweet to a Twitter account, indicating the number of days remaining until the end of the academic semester for São Leopoldo Mandic. The script should perform the following tasks:

1. Authenticate with the Twitter API using the provided consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret.
2. Every day at a specific time (e.g., 16:00 UTC), calculate the number of days remaining until the end of the semester (assuming the semester ends on day 348 of the year).
3. Generate an image with the countdown text using the PIL library, overlaying the number of days remaining on a provided template image (`template.png`).
4. Post the generated image to Twitter with a status message that includes the countdown text.
5. The script should run continuously and only post once per day at the specified time.

The function should calculate the decay value based on the given `decay_type`. The `decay_type` can be one of the following: `'proportional'`, `'square'`, or `'logarithmic'`.

The decay calculations are as follows:
- For `'proportional'` decay, the decay value is calculated as `max_iter / (i + 1)`.
- For `'square'` decay, the decay value is calculated as `max_iter / (i * i)`.

In a simulated environment, agents are entities that can perform actions to improve their satisfaction based on certain constraints. Each agent has a satisfaction level, a set of actions it can perform, and a geometry representing its state. The goal is to run a simulation where each agent tries to improve its satisfaction by performing actions until it is either satisfied or has no more actions to try.

Write a Python program that simulates the lifecycle of agents. The program should include the following functionalities:

1. An `Agent` class with the following attributes and methods:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for the agent.
    - `satisfaction`: A float representing the agent's current satisfaction level.
    - `actions_to_try`: A list of action proposals the agent can try to improve satisfaction.
    - `feature`: A dictionary with a key `'geometry'` representing the agent's current state.
    - `compute_satisfaction()`: A method to compute the agent's satisfaction.
    - `update_action_proposals()`: A method to update the list of actions the agent can try.
    - `get_best_action_proposal()`: A method to get the best action proposal from `actions_to_try`.
    - `clean_states()`: A method to clean the previously created and stored states (if any).

2. A `run_agents` function that takes a list of `Agent` instances and runs their lifecycle until they are satisfied or have no more actions to try. The function should support different lifecycle strategies (e.g., 'basic') and optionally store the states of agents.

3. A `__activate_agent_basic` function that represents the basic lifecycle of an agent. It should:
    - Clean the agent's states if `store_states` is `True`.
    - Compute the agent's satisfaction.
    - Update the agent's action proposals.
    - Try actions to improve satisfaction until the agent is satisfied or has no more actions to try.

4. The program should allow for verbosity levels to print information about the agents' processing steps.

5. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

    - `people_dict`: a dictionary where keys are names (strings) and values are phone numbers (also strings).

2. The function should first call a helper function `say_hello` that prints ""Hello"" `n` times.

3. Then, the function should check if the string ""sri"" is in `names_list`. If it is, print ""found""; otherwise, print ""not found"".

4. Next, the function should check if ""sri"" is a key in `people_dict`. If it is, print ""Found : "" followed by the corresponding value.

5. Finally, the function should swap the values of two variables `x` and `y` (initialized to 1 and 5, respectively) and print their values before and after the swap.

The function should not return anything.

Write a program that implements a simple calculator that can evaluate arithmetic expressions. The calculator should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, as well as parentheses to alter the precedence of these operations.

The program should consist of two main components: a scanner (`calcscanner`) and a parser (`calcparser`). The scanner's role is to read an input stream and convert it into a list of tokens, where each token represents a number, an operator, or a parenthesis. The parser's role is to take this list of tokens and construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the expression. Finally, the program should evaluate the AST to produce the result of the expression.

The `calcscanner` should define a class `calcScanner` with a method `scan` that tokenizes the input string. The `calcparser` should define a class `calcParser` with a method `parse` that takes the list of tokens from the scanner and builds the AST.

The AST can be represented by a class hierarchy where each class corresponds to a type of expression (e.g., binary operation, number, etc.). The evaluation of the AST should be done by a method `evaluate` that recursively computes the value of the expression represented by the AST.

The program should read an arithmetic expression from standard input, tokenize it, parse it into an AST, and then evaluate the AST to print the result.

Write a Python script that simulates a simplified version of Django's admin site registration process for models. Your script should define a mock admin site and two mock models. The admin site should have a method to register models and store them in a registry. The script should also include functionality to list all registered models and check if a specific model is registered.

The models do not need to have any fields or methods; they can simply be empty classes that serve as placeholders. The admin site's registry can be a simple dictionary where the keys are the model names and the values are the model classes themselves.

Additionally, provide test cases to verify that models can be registered, listed, and checked for registration correctly.

Design a Python class `GenreFeatureData` that preprocesses audio files for genre classification. The class should be able to load audio files, extract features, and serialize the processed data for training, validation, and testing datasets. The features to be extracted from each audio file include MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), spectral centroid, chroma-stft (short-time Fourier transform), and spectral contrast. The class should also be able to one-hot encode the genre labels and deserialize the preprocessed data for later use.

The class should follow these specifications:

1. Initialize with a default hop length of 512 for feature extraction.
2. Define a list of genres that are considered for classification.
3. Specify directories for training, validation, and testing audio files.
4. Implement a method to load and preprocess the data, which includes:
   - Extracting the audio features mentioned above.
   - One-hot encoding the genre labels.
   - Saving the features and labels as NumPy arrays.

In a communication system, signals are transmitted as strings containing lowercase letters. Each signal string contains a special marker that indicates important positions within the signal. There are two types of markers: 'packet' and 'message'. The position of the marker is determined by the following rules:

- For a 'packet' marker, the position is the index of the first vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in the string.
- For a 'message' marker, the position is the index of the last vowel in the string.

- `start_date`: A required date field for the expected start date of the project.
- `end_date`: An optional date field for the expected end date of the project.
- `open_for_students`: A boolean field to specify if students can participate in the project.
- `funding_available`: A boolean field to specify if there is funding available for the project.

You are tasked with creating a database access layer for a simple book database. The database has two tables: `book_info` and `vocab`. The `book_info` table contains information about books, including an `id` and `title`. The `vocab` table contains vocabulary words associated with each book, including a `book_id` and `word`.

Write two functions, `get_book_info` and `get_vocabs`, that interact with the database.

1. `get_book_info(con)`: This function takes a SQLite connection object `con` and returns a pandas DataFrame containing all rows from the `book_info` table. The DataFrame should have columns `id` and `title`. If there is a problem with the database connection, the function should raise a `pd.errors.DatabaseError`.

2. `get_vocabs(con, book_id)`: This function takes a SQLite connection object `con` and a `book_id` as arguments. It returns a list of vocabulary words associated with the given `book_id` from the `vocab` table. If the `book_id` does not exist in the `book_info` table, the function should raise a `ValueError`.

Include unit tests for both functions using the `pytest` framework to ensure they work as expected. The tests should cover the following scenarios:

- `get_book_info` returns a DataFrame with the correct columns.
- `get_book_info` correctly inserts and retrieves book information.
- `get_book_info` raises an error when the database connection is invalid.
- `get_vocabs` raises an error when an invalid `book_id` is provided.

Design a Python Django application that models a news aggregation system. The system should be able to track news articles from various sources and associate them with politicians. The application should consist of two models: `Source` and `Article`.

The `Source` model represents the news sources and should include the following fields:
- `name`: A string field representing the name of the source.
- `rss`: A text field representing the RSS feed URL of the source.
- `type`: A string field with choices 'agg' for aggregator and 'scrap' for scraper, defaulting to 'agg'.
- `image`: An optional image field representing the logo of the source, with images uploaded to the ""logos"" directory.

The `Article` model represents the news articles and should include the following fields:
- `headline`: A text field representing the headline of the article.
- `source`: A foreign key to the `Source` model, with a CASCADE delete strategy.
- `published`: A datetime field representing the publication date and time of the article.
- `link`: An optional text field representing the URL to the full article.
- `first_image_url`: An optional text field representing the URL of the first image in the article.
- `guid`: An integer field representing a unique identifier for the article.
- `created`: A datetime field that automatically sets the date and time when the article is created.
- `politician`: A many-to-many relationship with the `Politician` model, which can be blank.

Additionally, the `Article` model should have a string representation that returns its headline and a Meta class with a `verbose_name_plural` set to ""Articles"".

Create a program that constructs a dictionary of student details from user input. The dictionary should map student USNs (University Serial Numbers) to their respective names. The program should allow the user to input the number of student details they wish to enter, and then prompt them for the USN and name of each student. After all details have been entered, the program should print out the complete dictionary of student details.

Additionally, the program should include a function `search_student_by_usn(student_dict, usn)` that takes the student dictionary and a USN as arguments and returns the name of the student with that USN. If the USN is not found in the dictionary, the function should return ""Student not found.""

Create a Python program that manages a simple movie database for a cinema. The program should allow users to add new movies to two categories: ""Terror"" and ""Comedia"" (Horror and Comedy, respectively). Each movie entry should include the movie title, the cinema where it's being shown, and the ticket price. The program should also allow users to view the list of movies in each category.

The program should be structured as follows:

1. A main menu that prompts the user to choose between managing ""Terror"" movies, ""Comedia"" movies, or exiting the program.
2. Sub-menus for each movie category with options to add a new movie, show all movies, or return to the main menu.
3. Data for each movie should be stored in a text file (`terror.txt` for ""Terror"" movies and `comedia.txt` for ""Comedia"" movies) with each movie entry on a new line in the format: `title-cinema-price`.
4. The program should handle input errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages.

Write a function `is_height_balanced` that determines if a binary tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered height-balanced if for every node in the tree, the height difference between the left subtree and the right subtree is at most 1.

The function should take the root of the binary tree as an argument and return a boolean value indicating whether the tree is height-balanced or not.

Additionally, the function should calculate the height of the tree during the process. To facilitate this, a helper class `Height` is provided, which should be used to store the height of the tree.

The `Node` class represents a node in the binary tree and has attributes `data`, `left`, and `right`.

Here is the structure of the `Node` and `Height` classes, as well as the function signature for `is_height_balanced`:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Height:

def is_height_balanced(root, height):

class Height:
    def __init__(self):
        self.height = 0

def is_height_balanced(root, height):
    if root is None:
        height.height = 0
        return True

    left_height = Height()
    right_height = Height()

    l = is_height_balanced(root.left, left_height)
    r = is_height_balanced(root.right, right_height)

    height.height = max(left_height.height, right_height.height) + 1

    if abs(left_height.height - right_height.height) <= 1:
        return l and r

    return False

# Test cases to verify the solution
if __name__ == ""__main__"":

    root.right = Node(3)
    root.left.left = Node(4)
    root.left.right = Node(5)
    print('The tree is balanced' if is_height_balanced(root, height) else 'The tree is not balanced')

    root.left.left.left = Node(4)
    print('The tree is balanced' if is_height_balanced(root, height) else 'The tree is not balanced')

In the provided solution, the `is_height_balanced` function recursively checks each subtree to determine if the tree is height-balanced. It updates the height of the tree using the `Height` class and returns a boolean value indicating the balance status of the tree. The test cases demonstrate the function with both a balanced and an unbalanced binary tree.",Python,McEval-Instruct

The function should have a class `Solution` with a method `majorityElement` that implements the above functionality.

For example:

Write a Python script that merges structural information from two molecular dynamics simulation data files in the Ninfo format. The script should take a base Ninfo file containing the overall structure, a partial Ninfo file containing information about specific units, and an output Ninfo file to save the merged result. Additionally, the script should accept pairs of unit IDs and starting interaction point (imp) indices to correctly integrate the partial data into the base structure.

The script should perform the following steps:
1. Read the base Ninfo file and store its contents.
2. Read the partial Ninfo file and store its contents.
3. Remove interactions from the base Ninfo file that involve the specified unit IDs.
4. Add interactions from the partial Ninfo file to the base Ninfo file, adjusting the unit IDs and interaction point indices based on the provided starting imp indices.
5. Reassign interaction IDs in the merged Ninfo data to ensure they are unique and sequential.
6. Write the merged Ninfo data to the output Ninfo file.

The script should be robust to incorrect usage and provide a helpful usage message if the command-line arguments are not provided correctly.

Create a Discord bot command that generates a statistical report on player activity and economic data for a virtual game environment. The command should be a slash command named ""statistics"" that can be used by administrators to track player engagement and financial metrics over a specified date range.

The command should accept two parameters: `start_date` and `end_date`, both in the format ""DD.MM.YYYY"". If `end_date` is not provided, the report should cover the 24-hour period starting from `start_date`. The command should also accept an optional parameter `detail` which can be either ""Yes"" or ""No"" to indicate whether additional detailed information should be included in the report.

The report should include the following statistics:
- Maximum online players at any given time within the date range.
- Average online players during the date range.
- Average time spent per player in minutes.
- (If `detail` is ""Yes"") Number of new accounts registered.
- (If `detail` is ""Yes"") User retention rate (percentage of new users who played for more than 30 minutes).
- (If `detail` is ""Yes"") Total revenue from microtransactions.
- (If `detail` is ""Yes"") Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).
- (If `detail` is ""Yes"") Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU).

The bot should respond with an embed containing the requested statistics. If any errors occur (e.g., invalid date format, date out of range), the bot should send an appropriate error message.

Design a gradebook system that manages students, instructors, and classrooms. The system should be able to handle the following functionalities:

1. Create a new `Student` with a unique identifier and the ability to update their first name, last name, and date of birth (dob).
2. Create a new `Instructor` with a unique identifier and the ability to update their first name and last name.
3. Create a `Classroom` that can add or remove students and instructors, and print the list of current students and instructors.
4. Each `Student` and `Instructor` should have a unique identifier prefixed with ""Student_"" or ""Instructor_"" followed by a UUID.
5. The `Classroom` should maintain separate lists for students and instructors.
6. Implement an `update_status` method for a `College` entity that accepts an `AliveStatus` enum with values `Deceased` and `Alive`.

Create a Python class-based system to generate HTML elements dynamically. The system should allow users to create HTML tags, set their attributes, and nest child elements. The tags should be able to render themselves as HTML strings. The system should also include a factory for creating tags easily and support both singleton tags (like `<br>`, `<img>`, etc.) and container tags (like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.).

The system should enforce the following rules:
- Singleton tags cannot have children. If an attempt is made to add children to a singleton tag, a `TagSingletonError` should be raised.
- Certain tags require specific attributes to be set (e.g., `<img>` requires `src`, `<link>` requires `href`). If these required attributes are not provided, a `KeyError` should be raised.
- The class names should be handled with a `class_` keyword due to `class` being a reserved keyword in Python. The classes should be space-separated in the final HTML string.
- The system should escape any unsafe content unless the `safe` attribute is set to `True` on the tag.

Implement the system following the provided code snippet, ensuring that all classes and methods are well-documented. Include test cases to demonstrate the creation of different HTML elements, setting attributes, nesting children, and handling errors.

Create a Python Django REST API that provides token-based authentication for two versions of an identity service: v2.0 (deprecated) and v3 (stable). The API should have two endpoints, `/v2.0/tokens` and `/v3/tokens`, which allow clients to obtain tokens by providing their tenant information. The tokens are used to authenticate against the identity service and retrieve a service catalog specific to the tenant.

The API should handle the following scenarios:
1. A `GET` request to either endpoint should return the version details of the identity service.
2. A `POST` request to `/v3/tokens` should accept tenant information, authenticate the user, and return a token along with the v3 service catalog.
3. A `POST` request to `/v2.0/tokens` should also accept tenant information, authenticate the user, and return a token, but it should convert the v3 service catalog to the v2.0 format before returning it.

The API should also handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for various failure scenarios, such as invalid tenant information or issues with the identity service.

Write a Python function `extract_iris_data` that takes a list of comma-separated strings representing rows of the Iris dataset and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width as floats, and the species as a string.

The function should follow these specifications:

1. The input is a list of strings, where each string is a comma-separated row of the Iris dataset.
2. The first row of the input list contains the headers and should be ignored.
3. The function should parse each of the remaining rows and convert the numerical values to floats.
4. The species name should remain a string.
5. The function should return a list of lists, with each sublist containing the parsed data from each row.
6. Do not use any libraries or built-in functions for parsing the data (e.g., `csv.reader` or `pandas`). The goal is to practice string manipulation and type conversion.

Write a Python program that simulates a basic configuration loader for a web application. The program should be able to read environment variables and use them to determine the settings for different deployment environments (e.g., development, testing, production). The configuration should include at least the following settings: `DEBUG`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

The program should define a function `get_config()` that returns a dictionary with the configuration settings based on the current environment. The environment should be determined by an environment variable named `ENVIRONMENT`. If `ENVIRONMENT` is not set, the default environment should be `development`.

The `get_config()` function should also ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set. If it is not set, the function should raise an `EnvironmentError` with an appropriate message.

Write a Python function `convert_collection` that takes a collection (list, tuple, set, or dictionary) and a target collection type (list, tuple, set, or dict) and converts the given collection to the target collection type.

The function should meet the following requirements:

1. If the input collection is a list or a tuple, it can be converted to any of the target collection types.
2. If the input collection is a set, it cannot be converted to a dictionary directly since sets do not have key-value pairs. It should be converted to a list or tuple first, and then if the target type is dict, each element should be used as a key with a default value `None`.
3. If the input collection is a dictionary, it can be converted to a list of tuples (key-value pairs), a set of keys, or a tuple of key-value pairs.
4. If the target collection type is the same as the input collection type, return the collection as is.

Design a Django RESTful API for a user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, refresh their JWT tokens, change their password, update their profile, log out, and log out from all sessions. The API should use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and should include the following endpoints:

1. `login/` - Allows users to obtain a pair of access and refresh JWT tokens by providing their username and password.
2. `login/refresh/` - Allows users to refresh their access token using a refresh token.
3. `register/` - Allows new users to register by providing their username, email, and password.
4. `change_password/<int:pk>/` - Allows authenticated users to change their password by providing the old and new passwords. The `<int:pk>` in the URL is the user's primary key (ID).
5. `update_profile/<int:pk>/` - Allows authenticated users to update their profile information. The `<int:pk>` in the URL is the user's primary key (ID).
6. `logout/` - Allows authenticated users to log out from the current session.
7. `logout_all/` - Allows authenticated users to log out from all sessions.

Create a Discord bot that manages a virtual restaurant with chefs and customers. The bot should be able to handle various commands related to the restaurant's operations, such as assigning roles to new members, managing chef departments, and sending greetings. The bot should also be able to handle errors gracefully and provide developer-specific commands.

The bot should have the following features:

1. Load a set of predefined cogs (extensions) that handle different aspects of the bot's functionality.
2. Use a configuration class to load settings from a JSON file, including owner IDs, role IDs, channel IDs, and chef information.
3. Provide a command to assign a ""new member"" role to users who join the server and a ""member"" role after they have been verified.
4. Allow users to select their department if they are a chef, or assign them a ""no department"" role if they are not.
5. Send a welcome message to new users in a designated welcome channel.
6. Sync application commands upon startup.
7. Handle errors that occur during the loading of cogs and provide informative messages.
8. Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as the bot's token.

1. Join the Discord server and check if the bot assigns the ""new member"" role.
2. Verify that the bot sends a welcome message in the designated welcome channel.
3. Use a command to select a department as a chef and check if the bot assigns the correct role.
4. Check if the bot handles errors gracefully when a cog fails to load.
5. Use developer-specific commands to ensure they are restricted to owner IDs.

Create a Python application using Tkinter that allows users to select a background scene and a sprite image, merge them together, and then save the merged image with compression. The application should provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following features:

1. Buttons to select a background scene image and a sprite image from the file system.
2. A button to merge the selected sprite image onto the center of the background scene image.
3. A button to save the merged image and compress it using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization matrices for the YUV color space.
4. A button to close the application.

The application should display the selected scene and sprite images side by side, and after merging, it should display the merged image. The compression should be performed on the YUV color space representation of the merged image, with chroma subsampling and quantization based on predefined matrices. The compressed image data should be saved to a file in a custom format with the extension `.mrg`.

Write a Python program that merges two lists of integers and prints out the combined list in ascending order. Each list of integers is provided by the user and is assumed to be unsorted. The program should first take the number of elements in the first list, followed by the elements themselves, and then the number of elements in the second list, followed by the elements themselves. The output should be a single line of integers sorted in ascending order, separated by spaces.

For example, if the user inputs:
```

Create a Python package named `math_operations` that contains a module `arithmetic`. This module should provide three functions: `add`, `multiply`, and `power_of_n`. 

- The `add` function should take a variable number of arguments and return their sum.
- The `multiply` function should also take a variable number of arguments and return their product.
- The `power_of_n` function should take one argument `n` and return a function that takes one argument and raises it to the power of `n`.

Write a Python script that imports this package and uses its functions to:
1. Calculate the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 using the `add` function.
2. Calculate the product of 1, 2, and 3 using the `multiply` function.

Create a Python script using the Scrapy framework to scrape a fictional adult content website, ""HotBabes4k"". The script should be designed to extract information about video scenes from the website. Each scene contains a title, description, date of release, image URL, list of performers, tags, trailer URL, and an external ID. The script should also handle pagination to navigate through multiple pages of scenes.

The website structure is as follows:
- The base URL for the website is `https://hotbabes4k.com`.
- Each model has a dedicated page that can be accessed through links found in the `//div[@class=""modelPic""]/a/@href` XPath.
- Each model's page contains multiple scenes. Scenes that are just photo sets are marked with ""Pics"" and should be ignored.
- Scene details can be found within a div structure, and the relevant information can be extracted using the following XPaths:
  - Title: `./h4/a/text()`
  - Description: `.//p/text()`
  - Image URL: `.//img/@src`
  - Duration: `.//div[contains(@class,""time"")]/text()`
  - Performers: `//div[contains(@class, ""modelBioTitle"")]/span/text()`
- The date of the scene should be set to the current date.
- The tags for each scene are static and should be set to `['Babe']`.
- The trailer URL is not available.
- The external ID can be extracted from the image URL using a regular expression that captures the numeric ID at the end of the URL.
- Pagination is handled by appending `/models/models_%s_d.html` to the base URL, where `%s` is the page number.

The script should define a Scrapy spider that navigates through the website, extracts the required information for each scene, and handles pagination up to a specified limit of pages.

Write a Python script that defines a Blender add-on for exporting custom data to a `.sre` file format, which is used for a game called ""Live For Speed"". The add-on should provide a user interface (UI) within Blender that allows users to export their 3D models to the `.sre` format. The script should include the registration and unregistration of the UI menu and the exporter class, as well as the necessary Blender version checks.

The exporter should be accessible from the ""File > Export"" menu in Blender. The UI should collect the following parameters from the user before exporting:
- Filepath: The destination path for the `.sre` file.
- Scale: A float to scale the model by before exporting.
- Apply Modifiers: A boolean to determine whether to apply modifiers before exporting.

Write a function `can_form_arithmetic_sequence` that determines whether a given list of integers can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. The function should return `True` if the list can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and `False` otherwise.

The function should adhere to the following requirements:
- The input list will contain at least two integers.
- The function should handle both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
- The function should return a boolean value.

For example:
- `can_form_arithmetic_sequence([3, 5, 1])` should return `True`, as the list can be rearranged to [1, 3, 5], which is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.
- `can_form_arithmetic_sequence([1, 2, 4])` should return `False`, as there is no way to rearrange the list to form an arithmetic sequence.

Design a Python program that manages configurations for a machine learning model deployment system. The system should be able to handle general configurations for the server and specific configurations for each model. The general configuration includes server host, server port, download URL, image upload settings, and debug mode. The model configuration includes a unique model hash, a template name for the model, a mapping of class IDs to human-readable class names, and optional image normalization parameters.

The program should consist of two classes: `GeneralConfig` and `ModelConfig`. The `GeneralConfig` class should be a dataclass that holds the general settings for the deployment system. The `ModelConfig` class should handle individual model settings, including generating the full model name by replacing a placeholder in the template name with the model's hash.

Implement the following features:
1. `GeneralConfig` should have default values for all attributes except `models_names`, which is a required field.
2. `ModelConfig` should have a method `get_model_name` that generates the full model name.
3. `ModelConfig` should have a method `get_value` that returns a parameter value if provided, or a default value otherwise.
4. Create instances of `ModelConfig` for a binary classification model and a multiclass classification model with their respective class mappings.
5. Create an instance of `GeneralConfig` that includes the names of the models from the `ModelConfig` instances.

Write a Python script that demonstrates the creation of these configurations and prints out the server host, server port, and the names of the models from the general configuration.

Write a Python script that acts as a Django management command to archive log entries older than a specified number of days into a separate database table before deleting them from the original log table. The script should move the log entries to an `ArchivedLogEntry` table and then remove them from the `LogEntry` table. The number of days should be provided as an optional argument, with a default of 30 days if not specified.

The script should follow these steps:
1. Parse the command-line argument to determine the number of days (default to 30 if not provided).
2. Calculate the cutoff date by subtracting the specified number of days from the current date.
3. Select all log entries from the `LogEntry` table with a timestamp older than the cutoff date.
4. Insert the selected log entries into the `ArchivedLogEntry` table.
5. Delete the selected log entries from the `LogEntry` table.
6. Print the number of archived and deleted log entries.

Assume that the `LogEntry` and `ArchivedLogEntry` models have the same fields and are already defined in the Django application.

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

from huxley.logging.models import LogEntry, ArchivedLogEntry

class Command(BaseCommand):
    args = '<days> (optional).'
    help = 'Archives and deletes all log entries older than a specified number of days (defaults to 30).'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        days = int(args[0]) if args else 30

        cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days)
        records_to_archive = LogEntry.objects.filter(timestamp__lt=cutoff)

        with transaction.atomic():
            # Archive the records
            archived_records = [ArchivedLogEntry(**record.__dict__) for record in records_to_archive]
            ArchivedLogEntry.objects.bulk_create(archived_records)

            # Delete the records from the original table

    # python manage.py archive_logs 60
    # This would archive and delete all log entries older than 60 days.
    pass
```

In this solution, we have added the functionality to archive the log entries before deletion. The `ArchivedLogEntry` model is assumed to exist and have the same fields as `LogEntry`. The script uses Django's `transaction.atomic()` to ensure that the archiving and deletion are treated as a single atomic operation, preventing data loss in case of an error during the process. The test cases section is a placeholder, as actual testing would require a Django environment with the models and data set up.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program that simulates a simple calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Prompt the user to enter the operation they wish to perform (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Perform the operation on the two numbers.
4. Print the result in a formatted message.
5. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program should print an error message and not perform the operation.
6. The program should handle invalid operation inputs by displaying an error message and not performing any calculation.

Ensure that your program includes appropriate error handling for non-numeric inputs and provides clear instructions to the user.

Create a simple HTTP server in Python that can handle GET and POST requests. The server should be able to serve JSON files, PNG images, and HTML content based on the request path. It should also log all requests to a file named `log.txt` with a timestamp. The server should be able to parse POST data and respond with a simple JavaScript alert message. Additionally, the server should implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to allow requests from specific origins.

The server should follow these specifications:

1. Serve JSON files when the request path ends with `.json`. The JSON file should be read from the server's local directory.
2. Serve PNG images when the request path ends with `.png`. The image file should be read from the server's local directory.
3. Serve HTML content for all other paths.
4. Log all GET and POST requests to `log.txt` with a timestamp and the type of request.
5. Parse POST data and log the `message` field from the POST data to `log.txt`.
6. Implement CORS headers to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` for GET requests and `http://192.168.1.30:8080` for POST requests.
7. Respond to POST requests with a simple JavaScript alert message.
8. The server should be able to start on a default port (8088) or a specified port passed as a command-line argument.

Design a Django application for an online education platform that allows users to interact with various entities such as courses, instructors, and educational institutions. The application should include models for user inquiries, course comments, user favorites, user messages, user courses, and promotional banners. Each model should inherit from a base model that includes common fields such as creation and update timestamps.

The models should meet the following requirements:

1. `UserAsk`: This model should store user inquiries about courses. It should include the user's name, mobile number, and the name of the course they are inquiring about.

2. `CourseComments`: This model should store user comments on courses. It should include a reference to the user, the course, and the comment text.

3. `UserFavourite`: This model should store user favorites, which can be courses, educational institutions, or instructors. It should include a reference to the user, the ID of the favorited item, and the type of favorite (course, institution, or instructor).

4. `UserMessage`: This model should store messages sent to users. It should include a reference to the user, the message content, and a flag indicating whether the message has been read.

5. `UserCourse`: This model should store the association between users and the courses they are taking. It should include a reference to the user and the course.

6. `Banner`: This model should store promotional banners. It should include the banner title, an image, a URL for redirection, and an index to determine the display order.

Implement the models in Django, ensuring that each model has a string representation that is meaningful and useful for administrative purposes. Use the given code snippet as a starting point and inspiration for your implementation.

The script should accept command-line arguments where each argument is a path to a binary file that needs to be read. If the `-r` flag is provided before a file path, the script should print the raw binary content of the file instead of the human-readable format.

The script should follow these requirements:
- It should handle multiple file paths provided as command-line arguments.
- It should check if the file exists before attempting to read it.
- It should print an error message if a file does not exist or cannot be opened.
- It should support the `-r` flag to toggle between raw and human-readable output.
- It should use the `xnbread` module's `dump` function to print the file contents.

            raw = False  # Reset the flag for the next file
```

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have some binary files to test with and the `xnbread` module installed. Since we cannot provide actual binary files here, you should create your own test files or use existing ones to test the script. Here's how you might call the script with test cases:

```bash
python script.py testfile1.bin
python script.py -r testfile2.bin
python script.py testfile3.bin testfile4.bin
python script.py -r testfile5.bin testfile6.bin
```

Each command should print the contents of the specified files, with the `-r` flag indicating that the raw binary content should be printed for those files.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a fictional database system, you are tasked with creating a Python function that will add a new user to a collection of users. Each user document should contain the user's first name, last name, and year of birth. The function should take these three pieces of information as parameters and add a new document to the 'users' collection with this data.

Write a Python function `add_user_to_collection` that simulates adding a new user to a database collection. The function should take three parameters: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `year_of_birth`. It should then create a dictionary with keys `'first'`, `'last'`, and `'born'`, and corresponding values from the parameters. The function should print a success message including the user's name and simulate the database operation by returning the dictionary.

Create a Python Flask web application that allows moderators of Reddit subreddits to customize the appearance of post titles using CSS. The application should provide an interface for moderators to input a post ID and a new title, which will then be reflected in the subreddit's stylesheet. The application should use the Reddit API to authenticate users and ensure that only moderators can make changes to their respective subreddits.

The application should have the following features:
1. A login route that authenticates the user via Reddit and obtains the necessary permissions.
2. A main page that displays the authenticated user's information and a list of subreddits they moderate.
3. A subreddit-specific page that allows the moderator to view existing CSS rules for post titles and add or update rules for specific post IDs.
4. A route to handle the submission of new or updated titles for a given post ID within a subreddit.
5. Proper error handling for OAuth exceptions, invalid post IDs, and unauthorized access attempts.

The application should use `praw` to interact with the Reddit API, `cssutils` to parse and update CSS, and Flask's session management to keep track of user authentication state.

- `data_type`: A string indicating whether to load 'train' or 'val' data.
- `image_dir`: The directory where the CIFAR-100 TFRecord files and their corresponding index files are located.
- `batch_size`: The size of each batch of data.
- `num_threads`: The number of CPU threads to use for data loading.
- `seed`: A random seed for reproducibility of data shuffling and augmentation.
- `dali_cpu`: A boolean indicating whether to perform the DALI pipeline operations on the CPU (`True`) or GPU (`False`).
- `gpu_num`: The number of GPUs to distribute the data across.

Create a Python Django application that allows users to register an account, receive an activation email, and activate their account through a unique link sent to their email. The application should also allow users to log out.

The application should include the following functionalities:

1. User Registration:
   - Users can register by providing their username, email, and password.
   - Upon registration, the user's account should be set to inactive.
   - An activation email with a unique link should be sent to the user's email address.

2. Account Activation:
   - Users can activate their account by clicking on the unique link sent to their email.
   - The link should be valid only for the user it was sent to and should expire after a certain period.
   - Upon successful activation, the user's account should be set to active, and a success message should be displayed.
   - If the activation link is invalid or expired, an error message should be displayed.

3. User Logout:
   - Logged-in users can log out of their account.
   - Upon logging out, a message should be displayed indicating successful logout.

The provided code snippet includes the necessary Django views and utility functions to implement the above functionalities. Your task is to write the complete solution, including the missing parts such as the `UserRegistrationForm`, `UserLoginForm`, `UserUpdateForm`, `user_not_authenticated` decorator, and `account_activation_token` generator, as well as the necessary Django templates and URLs configuration.

8435," Write a Python Discord bot command to calculate the optimal video bitrate for a given video duration, maximum file size, and audio bitrate to ensure the video file can be uploaded to Discord without exceeding the platform's file size limits.

The command should take three arguments:
1. `length`: The duration of the video in seconds.
2. `filesize`: The maximum file size allowed for the upload. This can be specified in megabytes with the options ""8M"", ""50M"", or ""100M"", or it can be an integer representing the number of megabytes (e.g., 8, 50, 100). If an invalid size is provided, default to ""8M"".
3. `audiobitrate`: The audio bitrate of the video in kilobits per second (e.g., ""128k""). If the ""k"" suffix is present, it should be removed for calculation.

The bot should calculate the video bitrate in kilobits per second that would allow the video to be uploaded without exceeding the specified maximum file size, taking into account the audio bitrate. The calculation should account for a small buffer to ensure the file size is safely within the limit.

The command should be named `clipbitrate` and should send a message to the Discord channel with the calculated video bitrate. If the provided `filesize` is not understood, the bot should default to ""8M"" and include a note in the response message.

2. `!clipbitrate 300 50M 192k` - This should calculate the bitrate for a 5-minute video with a 50MB file size limit and 192kbps audio bitrate.
3. `!clipbitrate 60 100M 320k` - This should calculate the bitrate for a 1-minute video with a 100MB file size limit and 320kbps audio bitrate.
4. `!clipbitrate 180 unknown 128k` - This should default to an 8MB file size limit and calculate the bitrate for a 3-minute video with 128kbps audio bitrate, including a note about the default file size.

You are tasked with preprocessing a dataset of tweets for a political sentiment analysis project. The dataset contains information about the tweets, as well as the gender, profession, and political ideology of the authors. The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning by performing the following steps:

1. Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Group the data by multiple columns (`label`, `gender`, `profession`, `ideology_binary`, `ideology_multiclass`) and aggregate the tweets.
3. Create a new DataFrame with the grouped information and the aggregated tweets.
4. Encode categorical features (`gender`, `profession`, `ideology_binary`, `ideology_multiclass`) using label encoding.
5. Normalize the tweets using a custom normalization function.
6. Lemmatize and tokenize the tweets using a custom lemmatization and tokenization function.
7. Save the preprocessed DataFrame to a new CSV file.

Design a Django middleware that logs the time taken by each view to execute. The middleware should log the start time before the view is called and the end time after the view has finished executing. It should then calculate the time taken for the view to execute and log this information in the format: ""View [view_name] took [time_taken] seconds.""

8440," Project Root Finder

Write a Python function `find_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project based on the programming language and the presence of certain files that are typically found in the root directory of projects written in that language. The function should support multiple programming languages and use a set of predefined rules for each language to find the root directory.

The function should take two arguments:
- `filepath`: A string representing the path to a file within the project.
- `language_id`: A string representing the programming language of the project (e.g., ""python"", ""rust"", ""java"").

The function should return the path to the root directory of the project as a string. If the root directory cannot be determined, it should return the directory of the given `filepath`.

The function should support the following programming languages and corresponding root directory indicators:
- Rust: presence of `Cargo.toml`
- PHP: presence of `composer.json`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: presence of `package.json`
- Python: presence of `__init__.py` or `setup.py`
- C#: presence of `project.json` or any `.csproj` file
- Java: presence of `.project` or `pom.xml`
- Haskell: presence of `stack.yaml` or any `.cabal` file

If none of the specific indicators are found, the function should look for version control system directories like `.git`, `.hg`, or `.svn` to consider as the project root. If none of these are found, it should default to using the directory of the `filepath` as the project root.

Write a Python script that evaluates the performance of a medical image segmentation model. The script should calculate the Dice coefficient (F1 score), Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, and recall for the predicted segmentation masks against the ground truth masks. The script should support evaluation on two datasets: ""Kvasir"" and ""CVC"". The ground truth masks for ""Kvasir"" are located in a directory named ""masks"", and for ""CVC"" in a directory named ""Ground Truth"". The predicted masks are stored in a directory structure that indicates the training and testing datasets used.

Design a program that can format and display a list of objects as a table in different formats such as plain text, CSV, and HTML. The program should be able to handle different types of objects as long as they have the attributes specified in the column names. The program should include a class hierarchy for different table formatters and a function to print the table using the specified formatter.

The `TableFormatter` class is an abstract base class with methods `headings(self, headers)` and `row(self, rowdata)` that should be implemented by subclasses to emit the table headings and a single row of table data, respectively.

The `TextTableFormatter`, `CSVTableFormatter`, and `HTMLTableFormatter` classes are concrete implementations of `TableFormatter` that format the table data as plain text, CSV, and HTML, respectively.

The `FormatError` exception should be raised when an unknown format is requested.

The `create_formatter(fmt)` function should return an instance of the appropriate formatter based on the `fmt` argument, which can be `'txt'`, `'csv'`, or `'html'`.

The `print_table(lst, colnames, formatter)` function should print the table using the provided formatter. It takes a list of objects `lst`, a list of column names `colnames`, and a formatter instance `formatter`. It uses the `headings` method of the formatter to print the column names and the `row` method to print each object in the list.

Design a Python class `User` that represents a user profile. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

- Attributes:
  - `first_name`: A string representing the user's first name.
  - `last_name`: A string representing the user's last name.
  - `age`: An integer representing the user's age.

- Methods:
  - `describe_user()`: This method should print the user's full name and age.
  - `greet_user()`: This method should print a personalized greeting to the user.

Additionally, create a subclass `Admin` that inherits from `User`. The `Admin` class should have the following additional attribute and method:

- Attribute:
  - `privileges`: A list of strings representing the admin's set of privileges.

- Method:
  - `show_privileges()`: This method should print out the admin's privileges.

Create a Python Django web application that provides a simple authentication system. The application should have two views: one for signing in and another for signing out. The sign-in view should display a login form when accessed via a GET request and handle user authentication when the form is submitted via a POST request. If the authentication is successful, the user should be redirected to the home page. If the authentication fails, the user should be informed with an error message. The sign-out view should log the user out and redirect them to the login page.

The following requirements must be met:

1. Use Django's built-in authentication system to authenticate users.
2. The sign-in view should render a template named 'login.html' located in a 'Login' directory.
3. The sign-in view should accept both GET and POST requests.
4. The sign-out view should simply log the user out and redirect to the login page.
5. Include appropriate error handling for failed authentication attempts.
6. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the sign-in and sign-out functionality.

In this solution, we have defined two views `signIn` and `signOut` that handle user authentication and deauthentication, respectively. We have also provided a `TestCase` class with three test methods to verify the correctness of the sign-in and sign-out functionality.

Write a Python program that simulates a word chain game called ""TorKham HanSaa"". In this game, players take turns to say a word that begins with the last two letters of the previous word. The game continues until a player cannot think of a word that follows this rule, at which point the game is over.

The program should accept a comma-separated list of commands and words from the user. The commands are as follows:
- `P <word>`: Play the word. If the word follows the rule (i.e., it starts with the last two letters of the previous word), it is added to the word chain. If it does not follow the rule or if it is the first word, the game is over.
- `R`: Restart the game. This clears the current word chain and starts over.
- `X`: Exit the game. This command ends the program.

If an invalid command is entered, the program should output an error message and terminate.

The program should print the current state of the word chain after each command, or the appropriate message if the game is over, restarted, or an invalid input is entered.

Design a Python program that creates a multiprocessing queue manager server that allows multiple clients to access and modify a shared queue. The queue should have a maximum size limit, and the server should run on a specified port with a given authentication key. The server should provide two methods for clients: `enqueue` to add an item to the queue and `dequeue` to remove and return an item from the queue. If the queue is full, the `enqueue` method should block until space becomes available. If the queue is empty, the `dequeue` method should block until an item is available.

The program should also include a client-side proxy that connects to the server and provides the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods to interact with the shared queue.

Write a Python script that implements the server and client proxy, and demonstrate its usage with test cases that show multiple clients interacting with the shared queue.

In a 2D grid representing a map of an art gallery, each cell is painted with one of three colors: red (R), green (G), or blue (B). An art enthusiast is interested in counting the number of distinct color regions in the gallery. A color region is defined as a group of contiguous cells of the same color, connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

Additionally, the art enthusiast is colorblind to green and perceives it as red. Therefore, they are interested in two counts: the number of distinct color regions as seen by a person with normal vision, and the number seen by a person who cannot distinguish between red and green.

Write a function `count_color_regions` that takes an integer `N` and a list of strings `gallery`, where `N` is the size of the 2D grid (N x N) and each string in `gallery` represents a row in the grid.

Design a reinforcement learning environment for a self-driving car simulation where the agent learns to drive by maximizing the distance traveled without crashing or exceeding the track boundaries (measured by Cross Track Error, CTE). The environment should use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode the input images from the car's perspective into a lower-dimensional latent space, which is then used as input for the reinforcement learning algorithm.

The task is to implement a training pipeline that sets up the environment, normalizes the input data, stacks frames for temporal consistency, and trains a reinforcement learning model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The pipeline should also handle the loading of pre-trained models and VAEs, as well as the saving of the trained models, VAE, and normalization statistics.

The training script should be configurable via command-line arguments, allowing the user to specify various options such as the algorithm to use, the number of timesteps to train for, the path to a pre-trained agent, the path to a pre-trained VAE, whether to save the VAE, and the logging directory for TensorBoard.

The script should also save the hyperparameters used during training in a YAML file for reproducibility.

- Properties `uuid` and `surface_schema` with appropriate getters and setters.
- Validation in setters to ensure that `uuid` is not `None` and is a string, and `surface_schema` is not `None` and is an instance of `BuildingSurfaceSchema`.
- A `__str__` method to return a string representation of the object in the format `""BuildingSurfaceResponse(uuid: {uuid}, surface_type: {surface_type}, area: {area}, orientation: {orientation})""`.

The `BuildingSurfaceSchema` class should have the following features:

Write a Python program that automates the process of injecting logging statements into Java source code files. The program should traverse a given directory, find all Java files, and perform the following modifications:

1. Import a custom logger class at the beginning of each Java file, if it's not already imported.
2. For each global variable, insert a logging statement after any line where the variable is modified outside of static methods.
3. Ensure that logging statements are not added within comment blocks or inline comments.

The logger should be imported as `import logger.Logger;` and the logging statement should be in the form of `Logger.log(this, ""variableName"");` where `variableName` is the name of the global variable being modified.

The program should also attempt to create a subdirectory named `logger` within the source code directory and copy a provided `Logger.java` file into this new directory.

Provide a clear docstring for the program, explaining its functionality, and include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

In a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, two players are competing against each other. Each player's choice is represented by a letter. For the opponent, the choices are represented by 'A' for Rock, 'B' for Paper, and 'C' for Scissors. For you, the choices are represented by 'X' for Rock, 'Y' for Paper, and 'Z' for Scissors.

The game is scored as follows:
- A draw (both players choose the same) awards 3 points.
- A win (your choice beats the opponent's choice) awards 6 points plus the score value of what you played (Rock: 1, Paper: 2, Scissors: 3).
- A loss (opponent's choice beats your choice) awards 0 points.

The game is played in two parts:
1. In the first part, you play according to a predetermined strategy guide, which is a sequence of your choices represented by 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'.
2. In the second part, you need to deduce the best move based on the opponent's choice and a strategy guide that tells you whether you need to win ('Z'), draw ('Y'), or lose ('X').

Design a Flask web application that serves as a simple search engine with rate limiting and logging features. The application should have the following specifications:

1. The application should initialize Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.
2. It should have a rate-limiting feature that tracks the number of requests from each IP address. If an IP address makes more than 20 requests within a certain time frame, it should return a message indicating that the access rate is too high and ask the user to try again later. If an IP address exceeds 100 requests, it should return a 403 Forbidden status.
3. The application should have two routes:
    - The root route (`""/""`) should handle both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, it should display a search form. For POST requests, it should accept a search query, log the search along with the requester's IP address, and return search results using a utility function `utils.search(query)`. If the query is empty, contains only whitespace, or contains a specific string, it should return a message asking the user to input a class.
    - The route `""/generate_code""` should handle GET requests and accept a result parameter. It should call a utility function `utils.get_course(result)` and render the results on a page.
4. The application should log all search queries along with the timestamp and the requester's IP address to a file named ""search.log"".
5. The application should use a background thread to clear the list of tracked IP addresses every second.
6. The application should set a flag to stop the background thread when the application is shutting down.

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can perform the following actions:

1. Start the Flask application and visit the root route (`""/""`) in a web browser. You should see a search form.
2. Submit a search query and check if the results are displayed and if the query is logged in ""search.log"".
3. Make more than 20 requests from the same IP address to test the rate-limiting feature.
4. Visit the `""/generate_code""` route with a result parameter and verify that the correct page is rendered.

Please note that the actual utility functions `utils.search(query)` and `utils.get_course(result)` are assumed to be implemented in a separate module named `utils.py`, which is not provided here. You would need to create mock implementations of these functions for testing purposes.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Create a Flask web service that allows users to check the pitch accuracy of their pronunciation for a given Japanese word. The service should accept a POST request with JSON data containing a base64-encoded audio file of the user's pronunciation and the word they are attempting to pronounce. The audio file should be in WebM format.

The service should decode the audio file, convert it to WAV format using `ffmpeg`, and then analyze the pitch contour of the pronunciation. It should compare the user's pitch contour with the expected pitch contour for the given word, which is stored in a `word_map` dictionary. The `word_map` dictionary maps words to their respective data, including the expected pitch contour, the peak pitch position, and the moras (syllables) of the word.

The pitch analysis is performed by the `get_avg_syllable_pitches` function, which takes the path to the WAV file and the moras of the word as arguments and returns the average pitch for each syllable. The `pitch_contour_similarity` function then takes the expected pitch contour, the user's pitch contour, and the peak pitch position to calculate a similarity score.

The service should return a JSON response with the similarity score. If the word is not found in the `word_map`, it should return a 404 error with an appropriate message. If `ffmpeg` fails to convert the audio, it should return a 500 error with an error message.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the following test cases:

1. Send a POST request with valid JSON data containing a base64-encoded WebM audio file and a word that exists in the `word_map`. Expect a JSON response with a similarity score.

2. Send a POST request with valid JSON data containing a base64-encoded WebM audio file and a word that does not exist in the `word_map`. Expect a 404 error with an error message.

3. Send a POST request with valid JSON data containing a base64-encoded WebM audio file that cannot be converted by `ffmpeg`. Expect a 500 error with an error message.

4. Send a POST request with incomplete JSON data (missing either the audio or the word). Expect a 400 error with an error message.

Please note that actual test cases would require setting up the `word_map` and `koutei` modules, as well as providing actual audio files and expected results for comparison.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a PyTorch module for predicting the loss of a neural network during training, which can be used to guide active learning. The module should take intermediate features from a given model and predict the loss for each data point. The prediction should be based on the difference between the predicted loss and the actual loss, using a custom loss function called `LossPredLoss`. The module should also include a method to build an optimizer for the loss prediction module.

The `LossPredLoss` function should compute the loss based on the margin ranking loss, where the margin is a hyperparameter that defines the minimum difference between the predicted and actual losses for a pair of data points. The function should support batch processing, where the batch size must be even, and it should support two reduction methods: 'mean' and 'none'.

The `LossPrediction` class should implement the following:
- A constructor that initializes global average pooling layers and fully connected layers based on the given feature sizes and number of channels.
- An `extract_features` method that takes a batch of data and a model, and extracts intermediate features and the corresponding losses using the model.
- A `forward` method that takes a batch of data and a model, predicts the loss for each data point, and if in training mode, computes the loss using `LossPredLoss`.

The `build_loss_prediction_optimizer` function should create an SGD optimizer for the loss prediction module with the given learning rate, momentum, and weight decay.

Design a text-based adventure game where the player can navigate through different rooms in a virtual house. Each room has a name, a description, and connections to other rooms in various directions. The player can move from one room to another by typing the direction they want to go. The game should handle invalid directions and unrecognized commands gracefully. Additionally, implement a feature that allows the player to type short forms of directions (e.g., 'n' for 'north').

Write a Python class `Room` that represents a room in the game. The class should have an `__init__` method that initializes the room with its name, description, and connections to other rooms. It should also have a `move` method that updates the current room based on the direction the player wants to move.

Design a Python class `SATTileTree2D` that efficiently computes the sum and average of elements in a 2D region of a 3D array with multiple channels. The class should use a Summed-Area Table (SAT) approach to allow for fast queries of rectangular regions within the array. The class should support the following operations:

1. `__init__(self, values)`: Initialize the SATTileTree2D with a 4D NumPy array `values` of shape `(depth, height, width, channels)`. The constructor should precompute the SAT for the given array.

2. `query_sum(self, z1, y1, x1, z2, y2, x2)`: Return the sum of elements in the rectangular region defined by the corners `(z1, y1, x1)` and `(z2, y2, x2)` for each channel. The region is inclusive of `z1, y1, x1` and exclusive of `z2, y2, x2`.

3. `query_average(self, z1, y1, x1, z2, y2, x2)`: Return the average of elements in the rectangular region defined by the corners `(z1, y1, x1)` and `(z2, y2, x2)` for each channel.

4. `get_sat(self)`: Return the computed SAT as a 4D NumPy array.

5. `size(self)`: Return the size in bytes of the SAT data structure.

Design a Python program that generates a report on bicycle ride statistics by querying a database for the last 12 hours of data. The report should include visualizations of the gender distribution and age ranges of riders, as well as some key metrics such as the total number of rides, mean total power, mean power output, and mean heart rate. The data is stored in an AWS Aurora PostgreSQL database, and the program should use the Plotly library to create the graphs. The program should also be able to save the generated graphs as images.

The program should include the following functionalities:

1. Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
2. Query the database to retrieve data on rides and users within the last 12 hours.
3. Generate a pie chart showing the gender distribution of riders.
4. Generate a bar chart showing the distribution of riders across different age ranges.
5. Calculate and return the total number of rides in the queried data.
6. Calculate and return the mean total power of all rides.
7. Calculate and return the mean power output per rider.
8. Calculate and return the mean heart rate per rider.
9. Save the generated pie and bar charts as images.

The program should be robust, handle potential errors, and follow best practices for querying and handling data.

Design a Python class `GroundMotionPlotter` that generates plots of ground motion intensity measures (IMs) such as Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), Spectral Acceleration (SA), etc., against distance for a set of ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The class should be able to handle both median ground motion values and their standard deviations (sigma).

The class should have the following features:
- It should accept a list of magnitudes, distances, GMPEs, IMTs (Intensity Measure Types), and other necessary parameters.
- It should be able to plot on both logarithmic and linear scales.
- It should include labels and legends that are appropriate for the type of plot.
- It should be able to handle different distance types (e.g., Joyner-Boore distance, rupture distance).
- It should be able to plot both median ground motion values and their standard deviations.

The class should be built upon the given code snippet, which includes necessary imports, constants, and a partial implementation of the plotting functionality.

A game awards points to players through three types of scoring actions: tries, transformations, and drop goals. Each try is worth 5 points, each transformation is worth 2 points, and each drop goal is worth 3 points. Given a player's total score, write a function `find_scoring_combinations` that calculates all possible combinations of tries, transformations, and drop goals that add up to the player's score.

The function should take a single integer argument `score` and return a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three integers representing the number of tries, transformations, and drop goals, respectively, that add up to the given score. The combinations should be returned in ascending order based on the number of tries, then transformations, and finally drop goals.

Design a Python class `Matrix` that represents a 2D matrix of scalar values. The class should support the following operations:

1. Initialization from a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
2. Indexing to access and modify individual elements using matrix[row][column] syntax.
3. Getting the total number of elements in the matrix.
4. String representation that returns the class name.
5. Boolean representation that checks if the matrix is non-empty.
6. Equality comparison to check if two matrices have the same shape and elements.
7. A generator method that yields each row of the matrix as a new `Matrix` object if the matrix has more than one row, or yields individual scalar elements otherwise.
8. Conversion to a Python list of lists.
9. Accessing an element by a single index as if the matrix were flattened into a list.
10. Getting the shape of the matrix as a new `Matrix` object containing two `Scalar` values (number of rows and columns).
11. Accessing a specific row as a new `Matrix` object.
12. Accessing a specific column as a new `Matrix` object.
13. Copying the matrix.
14. Transposing the matrix.

The `MatrixRow` class represents a row in the matrix and should support indexing, modification, length checking, boolean representation, string representation, and conversion to a Python list.

The `MatrixIndex` and `MatrixSubscripting` classes are placeholders for future functionality and should have basic representations.

Write a Python function `add_column_to_table` that adds a new column to an existing table in a database using SQLAlchemy. The function should check if the column already exists before attempting to add it. If the column does not exist, it should add the column and log the action. If the column already exists, it should log that the column already exists and not attempt to add it.

The function should take the following parameters:
- `table_model`: The SQLAlchemy ORM class representing the table to which the column should be added.
- `column_name`: The name of the column to be added.
- `column_type`: The SQLAlchemy type of the column to be added (e.g., `String`, `Integer`, `Text`, etc.).

The function should use the SQLAlchemy `Inspector` to introspect the database and check for the existence of the column. It should also use the `Session` object from `z3c.saconfig` to execute the SQL command and `datamanager.mark_changed` from `zope.sqlalchemy` to mark the session as changed if a column is added.

Write a Python program that defines a function `plan_party` which takes two arguments: `guest_count` and `snacks_per_guest`. The function should calculate the total number of snacks needed for the party and print out a message with the number of guests, the number of snacks per guest, and the total number of snacks needed. Additionally, the function should check if the number of snacks is sufficient for a party of that size (assume a party is sufficient if there are at least 3 snacks per guest). If the snacks are sufficient, it should print a message saying the party is well-stocked, otherwise, it should print a message indicating more snacks are needed.

The function should be able to handle direct numerical input, variables, and arithmetic operations within the arguments.

After defining the function, demonstrate its usage with the following scenarios:
1. Directly passing the number of guests and snacks per guest.
2. Using variables to store the number of guests and snacks per guest before passing them to the function.
3. Passing arithmetic operations as arguments to calculate the number of guests and snacks per guest.

Design a Python program that models geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. The program should include a base class `Base` and two derived classes `Rectangle` and `Square`. The `Base` class should handle unique id assignment for all instances. The `Rectangle` class should represent a rectangle with width, height, and optional x, y coordinates for positioning. The `Square` class should represent a square, which is a special case of a rectangle where the width and height are equal.

Implement the following functionalities:
1. `__str__` method for both `Rectangle` and `Square` that returns a string representation of the shape in the format: `[<class name>] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>` for rectangles and `[<class name>] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <size>` for squares.
2. `display` method for both `Rectangle` and `Square` that prints the shape using the `#` character. The shape should be offset by its x and y coordinates.
3. `update` method for both `Rectangle` and `Square` that allows updating the attributes via non-keyword and keyword arguments. The method should also validate the types and values of the attributes, raising `TypeError` for incorrect types and `ValueError` for invalid values (e.g., negative dimensions).

Write unit tests using the `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of the `__str__`, `display`, and `update` methods for both `Rectangle` and `Square` classes.

Write a Python script using Scrapy to scrape information about LEGO sets from a given year.

Create a Python Django REST API endpoint that retrieves the details of a real estate listing by its unique identifier (ID). The endpoint should be a read-only operation, meaning it should only support the HTTP GET method. The API should respond with the serialized data of the listing if found, or an appropriate HTTP 404 Not Found status if the listing does not exist.

The `Listing` model has the following fields:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
- `title`: A string representing the title of the listing.
- `price`: A decimal field representing the price of the listing.
- `description`: A text field containing a description of the listing.
- `created_at`: A datetime field representing when the listing was created.

The `ListingSerializer` is a Django REST Framework serializer that serializes the `Listing` model.

Write a Django view function named `api_detail_listing` that:
- Takes a `request` object and a `listing_id` as parameters.
- Uses the Django shortcut `get_object_or_404` to retrieve the `Listing` instance with the provided `listing_id`.
- Serializes the `Listing` instance using `ListingSerializer`.
- Returns a `Response` object with the serialized data if the listing exists.
- Returns a `Response` object with the HTTP 404 Not Found status if the listing does not exist.

Write a Python function named `extract_ultrasound_images` that processes a set of ultrasound images to remove the surrounding black space and extract only the ultrasound image content. The function should use the OpenCV library to perform edge detection and contour finding to isolate the ultrasound image from the background. The function should take a single argument, `input_directory`, which is the path to the directory containing the `.jpg` ultrasound images. The processed images should be saved in a new directory named `processed_dataset` within the same parent directory as `input_directory`. The processed images should be resized to 430x360 pixels before saving.

The function should follow these steps:
1. Load each image from the `input_directory`.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Apply thresholding to create a binary image where the ultrasound content is separated from the background.
4. Find the contours in the binary image and sort them by area in descending order.
5. Extract the largest contour (assuming it's the ultrasound image) using a bounding rectangle.
6. Resize the extracted region of interest (ROI) to 430x360 pixels.
7. Save the processed image in the `processed_dataset` directory with the same filename as the original.

Include error handling for cases where the `input_directory` does not exist or is empty. Also, ensure that the `processed_dataset` directory is created if it does not already exist.

In a futuristic setting, a spaceship's life support system uses a diagnostic report consisting of a list of binary codes to determine the optimal settings for oxygen generation and carbon scrubbing. The diagnostic report is stored in a file named ""input.txt"", where each line represents a binary code.

The life support rating is calculated using two separate values: the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating. To find these ratings, the diagnostic report is processed using a special algorithm:

1. **Oxygen Generator Rating**: Start with the full list of binary codes. Then, for each position (starting from the leftmost bit), keep only numbers selected by the following criteria:
    - Determine the most common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the position being considered.

2. **CO2 Scrubber Rating**: Start with the full list of binary codes. Then, for each position (starting from the leftmost bit), keep only numbers selected by the following criteria:
    - Determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being considered.

Continue this process until only one number remains for each rating. Convert the final binary codes to decimal values to get the oxygen generator and CO2 scrubber ratings.

The life support rating of the spaceship is the product of the oxygen generator and CO2 scrubber ratings.

Write a Python program that reads the diagnostic report from ""input.txt"", calculates the oxygen generator and CO2 scrubber ratings, and outputs the life support rating of the spaceship.

Write a Python function `scrape_product_info` that extracts information about beauty products from a given webpage and saves the data into a CSV file. The function should take two arguments: `filename` (the name of the CSV file to be created without the extension) and `url` (the URL of the webpage to scrape).

The webpage contains a list of beauty products, each with a link to a JSON file containing detailed information about the product. The function should parse the HTML to find these links, then download and parse the JSON to extract the following product details:

- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
- Category ID
- Brand
- Product Name
- Option (Type and Value)
- Price (formatted as a decimal number)
- Description (concatenated text)
- Image names (up to 5 images, extracted from the URLs)

The function should write these details into a CSV file with the following column headers: `['sku', 'Category ID', 'Brand', 'Product Name', 'Option', 'Price', 'Description', 'image_name1', 'image_name2', 'image_name3', 'image_name4', 'image_name5']`.

Write a Python program that simulates the movement of two groups of points, P and Q, on a 2D plane. Each point moves in a straight line with a given speed and direction. The program should use the provided code snippet as a starting point and include the necessary classes and methods to represent points, vectors, and their movement.

The `Point` class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, x, y)`: Initializes a new point with coordinates (x, y).
- `set_direction(self, direction_speed)`: Sets the direction and speed of the point. `direction_speed` is a list where the first element is a `Vector` object representing the direction, and the second element is a float representing the speed.
- `move(self)`: Updates the point's position based on its direction and speed.

The `Vector` class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, x, y)`: Initializes a new vector with components (x, y).

The `main_task` function should take two lists of `Point` objects, P and Q, and simulate their movement for 10 time steps. After each time step, the function should print the coordinates of all points in both groups.

**Test Cases**:

When you run the `main()` function, it should simulate the movement of points in groups P and Q for 10 time steps and print their coordinates after each step.

Design a Python class `PValueAnalysis` that inherits from the abstract class `Analysis`. The `PValueAnalysis` class should implement the methods to calculate the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and q-values for a given list of p-values. The p-values should be sorted in ascending order before any calculations.

The FDR is calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses (false positives). The q-value of an individual p-value is the minimum FDR at which the test may be called significant.

The `enumerate_reversed` method should be implemented to enumerate over the sorted p-values in reverse order, yielding both the index and the p-value.

The `create_fdr_list` method should return a list of FDR values corresponding to each p-value in the sorted list.

The `create_qvalues` method should return a list of q-values corresponding to each p-value in the sorted list.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the `PValueAnalysis` class methods.

In this problem, you are provided with a dataset of utterance counts from different linguistic models stored in a pickle file named `results.pkl`. The dataset contains results from four different models, each with a key in the format `L(Something)_5000`, where `Something` represents the model's configuration and `5000` indicates the number of utterances.

Your task is to perform a permutation test to compare the difference in the mean number of utterances between two models: `L(S(L,L0))_5000` and `L(S0)_5000`. The permutation test should randomly shuffle the combined utterance counts from both models and then split the shuffled data into two sets of equal size. The difference in means between these two sets is calculated, and this process is repeated 10,000 times to create a distribution of the difference in means.

You need to write a Python function `perform_permutation_test` that:
1. Reads the pickle file `tmp/results.pkl` and extracts the utterance counts for the two models.
2. Calculates the original difference in means between the two models.
3. Performs the permutation test as described above.
4. Plots a histogram of the sampled differences of means.
5. Prints the original difference in means, the number of sampled means, and the fraction of sampled means that are more extreme than the original difference in means.

The function should follow the given guidelines and include a docstring that describes its behavior, input parameters, and return values.

Design a RESTful API for a cooking recipe application using Django REST Framework. The application should allow users to manage recipes, ingredients, and tags.

Additionally, there should be an endpoint to upload images for recipes.

In the context of analyzing the results of a Bayesian inference process for exoplanet detection, you are tasked with creating a visualization tool that plots the prior distributions of various parameters involved in the model. The parameters are categorized into different groups such as ""Noise Params"", ""Stellar Params"", ""Period Params"", and ""Planet Params"". Each group contains multiple parameters, and for each parameter, there is a set of prior samples that represent the prior distribution.

Write a Python function `plot_priors` that takes in a `TICEntry` object (representing a target star), a dictionary of prior samples, a dictionary of initial parameter values, and an optional boolean flag `save`. The function should generate a grid of histograms, one for each parameter, organized by their respective categories. The histograms should be plotted using the prior samples, and if initial parameter values are provided, they should be indicated with a vertical line on the corresponding histograms.

The function should also save the plot to a file if the `save` flag is set to `True`, or return the `matplotlib` figure object if `save` is `False`.

In a population of organisms, individuals may possess different genotypes that affect their traits. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider a simplified model of inheritance for a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele (A) and a recessive allele (a). The possible genotypes are AA (homozygous dominant), Aa (heterozygous), and aa (homozygous recessive).

Given a population with six different genotype pairings, we want to calculate the expected number of offspring displaying the dominant phenotype in the next generation. The six genotype pairings are:

1. AA-AA
2. AA-Aa
3. AA-aa
4. Aa-Aa
5. Aa-aa
6. aa-aa

The file `genotype_counts.txt` contains the number of couples in the population that correspond to each of the six genotype pairings listed above, separated by spaces.

The probability that an offspring will display the dominant phenotype from each genotype pairing is as follows:

1. AA-AA: 100% (1)
2. AA-Aa: 100% (1)
3. AA-aa: 100% (1)
4. Aa-Aa: 75% (0.75)
5. Aa-aa: 50% (0.5)
6. aa-aa: 0% (0)

Assuming that each couple has exactly two offspring, write a function `calculate_dominant_offspring` that reads the number of couples from a file and calculates the expected number of offspring displaying the dominant phenotype.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple registration system which logs the user's name, age, and gender to a file with a timestamp. The program should prompt the user for their name, age, and gender, and then write this information to a file named `registrations.txt` in a formatted way. Each entry should be on a new line and include the current timestamp.

2. The program must append each new entry to the `registrations.txt` file, ensuring that previous entries are not overwritten.
3. Each entry must be formatted as follows: `[timestamp] Name: [name], Age: [age], Gender: [gender]`.

Write a Python function `generate_permutations_with_replacement` that generates all possible permutations of length `m` from a given list of `n` elements, allowing for the replacement of elements (i.e., elements can be repeated in the permutations).

Design a Python function that retrieves media records associated with a specific robotics team and year from a datastore. The function should filter out any media that does not match the team key or the specified year. The media records are stored in a datastore using Google App Engine's NDB client library.

Each media record is an instance of the `Media` class, which has the following attributes:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the media (string).
- `media_type_enum`: An enum representing the type of media (e.g., `MediaType.YOUTUBE_VIDEO`).
- `foreign_key`: A key to identify the media on external platforms (string).
- `references`: A list of NDB keys that reference other entities, such as teams (list of `ndb.Key`).
- `year`: The year the media is associated with (integer or `None`).

The `TeamYearMediaQuery` class is responsible for executing the query. It has a constructor that takes a `team_key` (string) and a `year` (integer), and a `fetch` method that returns a list of `Media` instances that match the query criteria.

Implement the `TeamYearMediaQuery` class and the `fetch` method following the test cases provided in the given code snippet. Ensure that the `fetch` method correctly filters out media records that do not have the correct team key, year, or both.

Design a Python class `SpectralTVAcousticSolver` that solves a thermoviscous acoustic problem in a spectral domain using the finite element method (FEM). The solver should handle complex frequencies and provide functionality for both direct solving using Dolfin's built-in solvers and solving via the PETSc interface.

The thermoviscous acoustic problem is described by the generalized linear equation `omega*BB*x - AA*x = 0`, where `omega` is the complex frequency, `BB` and `AA` are bilinear forms representing the system's mass and stiffness matrices, respectively, and `x` is the state vector.

The class should have the following features:

1. Initialization with a given domain and frequency, as well as additional keyword arguments.
2. A method `solve` that uses Dolfin's built-in solvers to solve the problem and returns the state vector.
3. A method `solve_petsc` that uses the PETSc interface to solve the problem and returns the state vector.
4. A method `create_ksp_solver` that creates a PETSc KSP object configured with MUMPS as a preconditioner.

Create a Python module that provides functionality to log the execution time of code blocks and functions. The module should include a context manager and a decorator that can be used to measure and log the time taken by a particular section of code or a function call. The logging should include a custom message and should be able to use different log levels.

The module should meet the following requirements:

1. The context manager should be named `ExecutionTimer` and should take parameters for a custom message (`title`), an optional logger object (`logger`), and an optional log level (`log_level`).
2. The decorator should be named `log_execution_time` and should also take parameters for an optional logger object (`logger`) and an optional log level (`log_level`).
3. Both the context manager and the decorator should log the start and end times of the execution, as well as the total time taken.
4. The module should use a default logger if none is provided.
5. The log level should default to ""DEBUG"" but can be set to other levels like ""INFO"", ""WARNING"", etc.
6. Include test cases to verify the correctness of the context manager and decorator.

Implement a Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture using TensorFlow. The architecture should consist of an Encoder and a Decoder, each with a specified number of layers. Each Encoder layer should include a Multi-Head Attention mechanism and a point-wise feed-forward network, and each Decoder layer should include two Multi-Head Attention mechanisms (one for self-attention and the other for encoder-decoder attention) and a point-wise feed-forward network. All layers should include dropout and layer normalization.

The implementation should allow for the following:
- Customizable number of layers for both the Encoder and Decoder.
- Customizable model size (`d_model`), which is the dimensionality of the input and output of the Encoder and Decoder layers.
- Customizable number of attention heads (`num_heads`) in the Multi-Head Attention mechanism.
- Customizable size of the feed-forward network (`dff`).
- Customizable activation function for the feed-forward network (`hidden_act`), with options for 'gelu' and 'relu'.
- Customizable dropout rate (`dropout_rate`) and layer normalization epsilon (`layer_norm_eps`).

Provide a class `Transformer` that encapsulates the Encoder and Decoder, and includes a method `call` that takes in input sequences, output sequences, training flag, look-ahead mask, and padding mask, and returns the final output of the Decoder along with attention weights.

Write a Python function `padded_sequence_average` that computes the average of sequences with padding. The function should take two arguments: a batch of sequences `X` and a padding mask `pad`. The sequences `X` are represented as a 2D PyTorch tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, where each row corresponds to a sequence and `pad` is a 2D PyTorch tensor of the same shape, containing `1`s for actual data and `0`s for padded elements.

The function should return a 1D PyTorch tensor of shape `(batch_size,)` containing the average of each sequence, excluding the padded elements.

Additionally, write a function `mean_feature_map` that computes the mean of a list of feature maps. Each feature map is a 2D PyTorch tensor and the function should return a 2D tensor with the mean feature map.

Design a Python program that provides a visual representation of progress for long-running operations. The program should include two types of visual indicators: a progress bar and a spinner. The progress bar should display the percentage of completion, elapsed time, and estimated time left for the operation. The spinner should simply indicate that an operation is ongoing without providing a measure of progress.

The program should be able to run both indicators simultaneously in separate threads, allowing the user to see both a progress bar and a spinner for different operations. The progress bar should be customizable with a label, delay between updates, and total number of cycles to complete. The spinner should also be customizable with a label and delay between updates.

Implement the `ProgressBarThread` and `SpinnerThread` classes, ensuring that they inherit from the `threading.Thread` class and override the `run` method to display the progress bar and spinner, respectively. Both classes should have `start` and `stop` methods to control the execution of the threads.

Design a Python program that acts as a Telegram bot for processing text messages and document uploads. The bot should authenticate users before processing their requests. It should handle two types of messages: text messages and document uploads. For text messages, the bot should process URLs. For document uploads, the bot should only process files with a `.torrent` extension. If a user uploads a document with a different extension, the bot should inform the user that the file type is unknown.

The program should use the Telebot library for interacting with the Telegram API and should include error handling and logging. The logging should record when the bot starts, when messages are received, and any errors that occur. The bot should respond to the user with a confirmation message after processing a request or an error message if something goes wrong.

The `Tgh` class, which is not provided, is assumed to have two methods: `auth` for authenticating users and `process_url` for processing URLs. It also has a `process_torrent` method for processing `.torrent` files. The bot should use these methods appropriately.

In this solution, we have defined a `Bot` class that initializes the Telebot instance with the provided token. It registers two message handlers for text and document content types. The `run` method starts the bot's polling. The `get_text_message` and `get_doc` methods handle text messages and document uploads, respectively, using the `Tgh` class methods for authentication and processing.

Design a space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and must survive waves of enemy ships. The game should include power-ups, a scoring system, and a high score record. The player's spaceship can move in all directions and shoot lasers to destroy enemies. The game ends when the player loses all lives or the spaceship's health reaches zero.

The game should have the following features:
- Player spaceship that can move and shoot lasers.
- Different types of enemy ships with varying health and point values.
- Power-ups that can restore health or provide temporary advantages.
- A scoring system that awards points for destroying enemies.
- A high score record that saves the best score achieved.
- A main menu where the player can start the game and enter their name.
- A game over screen that displays the player's score and rank in the high score record.

Write a Python program that simulates the movement of atoms within a periodic boundary condition box and records their positions at each timestep. The simulation should use a spatial partitioning technique to efficiently track and update the positions of atoms. The program should also be able to output the simulation data in a LAMMPS-compatible dump file format.

The simulation should be based on the following specifications:

1. The simulation box is cubic with a user-defined size.
2. Atoms are initially placed at random positions within the box.
3. At each timestep, atoms move to a new position based on a random displacement within a specified maximum distance.
4. The simulation should handle periodic boundary conditions, meaning atoms that move outside the box boundaries should reappear on the opposite side of the box.
5. The simulation should run for a user-defined number of timesteps.
6. The output dump file should include the timestep, number of atoms, box bounds, and the positions of atoms at each timestep.

Use the given code snippet as a starting point to implement the `Simulation` class, which will manage the simulation process, and the `writeDump` function to output the simulation data.

2. `PostForm` should be used to create a new blog post. It should include fields for the post title, content, and associated tag. The title and content should be required. The tag should be a dropdown menu populated with existing tags from the database. The form should have a submit button to publish the post.

3. `DeleteForm` should be a simple form with a hidden field to store the post ID and a submit button to confirm deletion of the post.

4. `LoginForm` should be used for user authentication. It should have fields for the username and password, both required. It should also include a submit button to log in. The form should validate the username against the database and ensure that the user exists.

In this solution, we have defined the necessary Flask routes and forms for creating tags, writing posts, deleting posts, and logging in. We have also defined the corresponding HTML templates (not shown here) for each form. The `validate_name` method in `TagForm` and `validate_user_name` method in `LoginForm` ensure that the tag is unique and the admin user exists, respectively. The `PostForm` constructor dynamically populates the tag choices from the database. The `DeleteForm` is designed to handle post deletions securely by using a hidden field for the post ID.",Python,McEval-Instruct

You are tasked with creating an automated test suite for a web-based To-Do list application using Selenium WebDriver and Python's unittest framework. The application allows users to create a personal to-do list, add items to it, and retrieve the list later. Each user's list should be unique and accessible via a unique URL.

Write a test class `ToDoAppTest` that extends from `unittest.TestCase` and includes the following test methods:

1. `test_user_can_create_list_and_retrieve_it_later`: This test should verify that a user can:
    - Visit the homepage of the To-Do app.
    - Notice the page title and header mention to-do lists.
    - Enter a to-do item into an input box.
    - Submit the item and see it added to the to-do list.
    - Retrieve the list later using a unique URL.

2. `test_multiple_users_can_create_unique_lists`: This test should verify that:
    - A second user can start a new browser session and create a new list without seeing the first user's list.
    - Each user's list is accessible via a unique URL.

3. `test_layout_and_styling`: This test should verify that:
    - The input box is nicely centered on the homepage and the new list page when the browser window is 1024px by 768px.

4. `test_cannot_add_empty_list_items`: This test should verify that:
    - Users cannot add empty list items.
    - An appropriate error message is displayed when attempting to add an empty list item.

**Note**: Assume that the `FunctionalTest` class from the given code snippet is a base class that sets up and tears down the Selenium WebDriver for each test. It also contains helper methods like `check_for_row_in_list_table` which you can use in your tests.

Write a function `calculate_power` that computes the power of a number using recursion.

Write a Python function `fetch_popular_repos` that interacts with the GitHub Search API to retrieve the most popular repositories for a given set of programming languages. The popularity is determined by the number of stars a repository has. The function should be able to filter repositories that have a minimum number of stars and should be able to sort the results in descending order based on the number of stars.

The function should take the following parameters:
- `languages`: A list of strings, where each string is a programming language (e.g., `['python', 'javascript']`).
- `min_stars`: An integer that sets the minimum number of stars a repository must have to be included in the results. The default value should be 50000.
- `sort`: A string that determines the attribute by which the results should be sorted. The default value should be `'stars'`.
- `order`: A string that specifies the order of sorting. The default value should be `'desc'`.

The function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the following information about a repository:
- `name`: The name of the repository.
- `language`: The main language used in the repository.
- `stars`: The number of stars the repository has.

If the GitHub API rate limit is reached, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` with the message `'Rate limit reached. Please wait and try again'`. If any other HTTP error occurs, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` with the message `'An error occurred. HTTP Status code: {response.status_code}'`.

Write a Python program that reads a log file containing training and testing metrics for a machine learning model over multiple epochs. The log file is divided into parts, each part separated by a line starting with the '#' character. Each part contains metrics such as ""Test AUC"", ""Test loss"", ""Train AUC"", and ""Train loss"" for a number of epochs. The program should extract these metrics and plot them over the epochs for each part of the log file.

Design a Python program that simulates an email processing system for a security sandbox environment. The system should monitor a directory for new `.msg` files, representing emails, and process each one to determine if it is a potential threat. The program should follow these specifications:

1. The program must be configurable through a settings file, with at least one setting to enable or disable the email processing feature.
2. The program should continuously monitor a specified directory for new `.msg` files.
3. For each new `.msg` file found, the program should:
    - Parse the email file to extract relevant information.
    - Log the parsing activity, including the message ID and the file path.
    - Check if the email has already been processed or exists in the database.
    - Analyze the email for potential threats. If the analysis fails or deems the email safe, skip further processing.
    - If the email is considered a potential threat, add it to a database for further action.
4. The program should handle cases where there are no new `.msg` files to process by waiting for a short period before checking again.
5. The program should include exception handling to manage any errors that occur during file processing or database operations.

The program should be designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy updates or changes to the email parsing, analysis, and database interaction components.

Design a Python class `NateWebtoonCrawler` that inherits from a base class `BaseWebtoonCrawler` and is specialized in crawling webtoons from the Nate website. The crawler should be able to extract the title and episode information of a webtoon given its title ID, and download the episodes' images and thumbnails.

The `NateWebtoonCrawler` class should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, title_info, crawl_type)`: Initializes the crawler with the given title information and crawl type.
- `get_episode_crawler(self, title_info, episode_info)`: Returns an instance of `NateEpisodeCrawler` initialized with the given title and episode information.
- `get_title_and_episode_info(self)`: Retrieves the title and episode information from the Nate webtoon list page and returns it as a tuple of dictionaries.
- `get_title_name(self, content_soup)`: Extracts and returns the webtoon title name from the BeautifulSoup object.
- `get_episode_infos(self, content_soup)`: Extracts and returns a list of dictionaries containing episode information from the BeautifulSoup object.

Additionally, design a `NateEpisodeCrawler` class that inherits from `BaseEpisodeCrawler` and is responsible for crawling individual episodes of a Nate webtoon. It should have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, title_info, episode_info, crawl_type)`: Initializes the episode crawler with the given title and episode information, and crawl type.
- `get_image_url(self, content_soup)`: Extracts and returns the URL of the episode's main image from the BeautifulSoup object.
- `get_thumbnail_url(self, content_soup)`: Extracts and returns the URL of the episode's thumbnail image from the BeautifulSoup object.
- `populate_episode_info(self)`: Retrieves the episode's thumbnail and image URLs, and writes the episode information to a log file in the specified directory.
- `thumbnail_filename_from_url(self, prefix, url)`: Generates a filename for the thumbnail image based on the URL and a prefix.
- `image_filename_from_url(self, prefix, url)`: Generates a unique filename for the episode's main image based on the URL, a prefix, and a timestamp.

The crawler should handle the creation of valid filenames for saving images and thumbnails, avoiding any characters that are not allowed in filenames.

Write a Python program that dynamically generates an ASGI configuration for a Django project. The program should take the project name as input and create an ASGI configuration script that sets up the ASGI application for the given Django project.

The ASGI configuration script should:
- Set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to the `<project_name>.settings`.
- Import the `get_asgi_application` function from `django.core.asgi`.
- Assign the result of calling `get_asgi_application()` to a variable named `application`.

You are tasked with creating a data processing pipeline to prepare COVID-19 vaccination data for analysis. The data comes from two CSV files hosted by Health Canada, one containing information about vaccination coverage and the other about the total number of vaccine doses administered. The goal is to merge these datasets, clean and transform the data, and output a single CSV file with the processed data.

The processing steps should include:
1. Reading the vaccination coverage data, which includes the number of people with at least one dose and the number of people fully vaccinated, for each week.
2. Reading the total doses administered data, which includes the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered.
3. Filtering the data to include only the records for Canada.
4. Renaming columns to more descriptive names.
5. Ensuring that the number of vaccinated people is represented as integers.
6. Merging the two datasets on the location and date fields.
7. Rectifying the total vaccinations data to ensure consistency.
8. Setting the vaccine type based on the date of the report.
9. Adding a source URL to each record.
10. Writing the final DataFrame to a CSV file.

   - ""🟨"" for an unopened cell
   - ""🚩"" for a cell with a flag
   - ""💣"" for a revealed mine (after losing)
   - ""0️⃣"" to ""8️⃣"" for opened cells, indicating the number of adjacent mines

You are tasked with creating a Django admin interface for an e-commerce platform. The platform has four main models: `Customer`, `Product`, `Cart`, and `OrderPlaced`. Each model has specific fields that need to be displayed in the admin interface.

Write a Python script using Django's admin module to create custom admin classes for each of the models mentioned. The admin classes should display the following fields for each model:

- `CustomerModelAdmin`: `id`, `user`, `name`, `locality`, `city`, `zipcode`, `state`
- `ProductModelAdmin`: `id`, `title`, `selling_price`, `discounted_price`, `description`, `brand`, `category`, `product_image`
- `CartModelAdmin`: `id`, `user`, `product`, `quantity`
- `OrderPlacedModelAdmin`: `id`, `user`, `customer`, `product`, `quantity`, `order_date`, `status`

Ensure that you register each model with its corresponding admin class using the `admin.site.register` method or the `@admin.register` decorator.

You are tasked with writing a program to process a batch of passport data to determine which passports are valid based on a set of rules. The passport data is stored in a text file named `data.txt`, where each passport is separated by two newlines. Each passport is a collection of key-value pairs separated by spaces or newlines.

A passport is considered valid if it meets the following criteria:

1. It contains all of the following fields: `byr` (Birth Year), `iyr` (Issue Year), `eyr` (Expiration Year), `hgt` (Height), `hcl` (Hair Color), `ecl` (Eye Color), and `pid` (Passport ID).
2. `byr` must be at least 1920 and at most 2002.
3. `iyr` must be at least 2010 and at most 2020.
4. `eyr` must be at least 2020 and at most 2030.
5. `hgt` must be a number followed by either `cm` or `in`:
   - If `cm`, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
   - If `in`, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
6. `hcl` must be a `#` followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.
7. `ecl` must be exactly one of: `amb`, `blu`, `brn`, `gry`, `grn`, `hzl`, `oth`.
8. `pid` must be a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.

Write a function `validate_passports` that reads the passport data from `data.txt`, processes each passport, and returns the number of valid passports. Include test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.

Design a Python function `authenticate_user` that uses Django REST framework serializers to validate user login credentials. The function should take two arguments, `email` and `password`, and return a dictionary with either a success message and the user's email if the credentials are valid, or an error message if the credentials are invalid.

The function should use the `AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer` to validate the credentials. Assume that the `User` model has an `objects` manager with a `filter` method that can be used to find users by email, and a `check_password` method that can be used to verify the password.

The `User` model is not provided, but you can assume it is a Django model with an `email` field and a `check_password` method.

Here is the code snippet for the `AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer`:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers

# Assume User is a Django model with an email field and a check_password method
class User:
    # Placeholder for the actual User model implementation
    pass

class AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    email = serializers.EmailField()
    password = serializers.CharField()

    def validate_email(self, value):
        user = User.objects.filter(email=value).first()

        if not user:
            raise serializers.ValidationError(""Invalid Credentials"")

        return value
```

","

```python
from rest_framework import serializers

# Mock implementation of the User model and manager for demonstration purposes
class UserManager:
    def filter(self, email):
        # Simulate database filter operation
        if email == ""valid@example.com"":
            return [User(email=email)]
        return []

class User:
    objects = UserManager()

    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def check_password(self, password):
        # Simulate password check
        return password == ""correctpassword""

class AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    email = serializers.EmailField()
    password = serializers.CharField()

    def validate_email(self, value):
        user = User.objects.filter(email=value).first()

        if not user:
            raise serializers.ValidationError(""Invalid Credentials"")

        return value

    def validate(self, data):
        user = User.objects.filter(email=data['email']).first()
        if user and user.check_password(data['password']):
            return data
        raise serializers.ValidationError(""Invalid Credentials"")

def authenticate_user(email, password):
    serializer = AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer(data={'email': email, 'password': password})
    if serializer.is_valid():
        return {'message': 'User authenticated successfully', 'email': email}
    else:
        return {'error': serializer.errors}

# Test cases
print(authenticate_user(""valid@example.com"", ""correctpassword""))  # Should return success message
print(authenticate_user(""invalid@example.com"", ""correctpassword""))  # Should return error message
print(authenticate_user(""valid@example.com"", ""wrongpassword""))  # Should return error message
```

In the provided solution, we have a mock implementation of the `User` model and its manager to simulate the behavior of a Django model. The `authenticate_user` function uses the `AuthenticateUserRequestSerializer` to validate the credentials and returns the appropriate response. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with valid and invalid credentials.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python program to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and also from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program should be able to take a temperature value and the unit of temperature (either 'F' for Fahrenheit or 'C' for Celsius) as input and convert it to the other temperature unit.

The program should define a function `convert_temperature` that takes two arguments: the temperature value (a float) and the unit of temperature (a string, either 'F' or 'C'). The function should return the converted temperature value rounded to two decimal places.

Additionally, the program should handle invalid temperature unit inputs by raising a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

Design a Django application for a coaching platform where coaches can add questions to a questionnaire and clients can respond to them. The application should have the following features:

1. Coaches can add new questions to the questionnaire, specifying the question text and category.
2. Clients can answer questions from the questionnaire, one at a time, based on categories such as sales, people, accounting, business, legal, and tech.
3. Clients' progress is tracked, and they cannot answer questions from a category if they have completed it.
4. Coaches can generate a PDF report of a client's responses, organized by category.
5. The application should enforce user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their respective views, and redirecting unauthorized users to the home page or sign-in page.

Implement the following views in Django:

- `add_questions`: Allows coaches to add new questions to the questionnaire.
- `questionnaire_responses_to_pdf`: Generates a PDF report of a client's responses, organized by category.
- `questionnaire_view`: Displays the main questionnaire page for clients.
- `answer_question`: Allows clients to answer questions from the questionnaire, one at a time, based on the category.

Ensure that the views are protected with the `@login_required` decorator and that the appropriate user role checks are in place.

Design a Python class `RedisGraphQueryTester` that extends `ModuleTestCase` from the `rmtest` library to test queries executed on a RedisGraph database module. The class should include methods to validate the following aspects of a query's result:

1. The actual results exactly match the expected results.
2. The actual results are contained within the expected results, with a specified number of results being contained.
3. The query execution time does not exceed a maximum runtime.

Each method should take in two parameters: `actual_result`, which is an object containing the query's result set and runtime, and `query_info`, which is an object containing the expected results, the number of expected contained results, and the maximum runtime in milliseconds.

The class should be able to handle cases where the actual results do not match the expectations by raising appropriate assertions. Additionally, if the runtime exceeds the maximum allowed time, a warning should be issued instead of an assertion error.

Implement the `RedisGraphQueryTester` class with the following methods:

- `_assert_exact_match_results`: Asserts that the actual results exactly match the expected results.
- `_assert_contained_results`: Asserts that the actual results are contained within the expected results, with a specified number of results being contained.
- `_assert_run_time`: Asserts that the query execution time does not exceed the maximum runtime and issues a warning if it does.

3. List all books in the library on a dedicated page.
4. Redirect users to a specific external URL when they visit the books redirect page.
5. Provide detailed information about a book when its slug is provided in the URL.
6. Redirect users to a specific book's detail page when its slug is provided in the URL.
7. Allow users to add a new book to the library using a form.
8. Provide a page to create a new book entry using Django's class-based `CreateView`.
9. Allow users to edit the details of an existing book using Django's class-based `UpdateView`.

Write a Python script that simulates a robot's movement control system using ROS (Robot Operating System). The script should include a service client that sends movement commands to a robot and a publisher that periodically publishes status messages to a topic.

The movement commands should be sent to a service named 'move' of type `Move`, which is provided by a hypothetical `ax2550_driver.py`. The `Move` service accepts two parameters: `linear_velocity` (a float representing the linear velocity in meters per second) and `angular_velocity` (a float representing the angular velocity in radians per second). The service returns a response with a boolean field `result` indicating whether the movement command was successful.

The status messages should be published to a topic named 'motor_control' of type `String`, and the message should be ""Movement command sent"" each time a command is issued.

The script should define two functions: `send_movement_command` and `talker`. The `send_movement_command` function should send a movement command to the 'move' service and return the result. The `talker` function should initialize the ROS node, handle the periodic publishing of status messages, and call `send_movement_command` every second.

Include exception handling for the service call, and ensure that the script can be terminated cleanly with a ROS interrupt exception.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would typically run the script in a ROS environment with the appropriate services and topics set up. However, since we cannot simulate a full ROS environment here, we can only provide a conceptual description of the test cases:

1. Test that the `send_movement_command` function sends a command to the 'move' service and receives a successful response.
2. Test that the `talker` function initializes the ROS node and publishes the status message ""Movement command sent"" to the 'motor_control' topic every second.
3. Test that the script handles service exceptions gracefully and prints an error message if the service call fails.
4. Test that the script can be terminated cleanly with a ROS interrupt exception (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C while the script is running).",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a plugin system for a hypothetical environmental monitoring application. The system should be able to load different sensor plugins and update their environmental data based on a specific update strategy. Each sensor plugin should have an `update` method that simulates the process of gathering new environmental data.

The provided code snippet is part of the `Sensors` class, which inherits from a `Plugins` class. The `Sensors` class manages a collection of sensor plugins and updates them using a staggered approach to balance the load. Specifically, it updates half of the sensors on each call to `update_environmental_data`, alternating between the two halves.

Your task is to:
1. Implement the `Plugins` base class with the following features:
   - A constructor that accepts a `suffix` parameter and initializes an empty list called `data`.
   - A method `load_plugin` that simulates loading a plugin with a given name by appending a new `SensorPlugin` object to the `data` list. The `SensorPlugin` class should be defined with an `update` method that prints the name of the sensor being updated.

2. Extend the `Sensors` class to override the `update_environmental_data` method as per the given code snippet.

3. Write test cases to demonstrate that the `Sensors` class correctly updates the sensor plugins in a staggered manner.

        partition = (self.environmental_data_update_tracker % 2)
        for index, sensor in enumerate(self.data):
            if (index % 2) == partition:
                sensor.update()

# Test cases

    print(""\nSecond update:"")
    sensors.update_environmental_data()
    print(""\nThird update:"")

This solution defines the `Plugins` base class and the `SensorPlugin` class as required. The `Sensors` class is extended to include the staggered update logic.

2. Each admin class should define `list_display` to specify which fields to display in the list view.
3. Each admin class should define `list_filters` to allow filtering by specific fields in the list view.
4. Each admin class should define `search_fields` to enable search functionality for specific fields.

Write a function `merge_k_sorted_lists` that merges `k` sorted linked lists and returns the merged sorted list. The `ListNode` class and the `Solution` class with the `mergeKLists` method are provided. The `mergeKLists` method should use a bottom-up merge sort approach to merge the lists efficiently.

The `ListNode` class is defined as follows:
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None
```

The `Solution` class is defined with the following methods:
- `mergeKLists(lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode`: This method takes a list of `ListNode` objects, each representing the head of a sorted linked list, and returns the head of the merged sorted linked list.
- `merge(head1: ListNode, head2: ListNode) -> ListNode`: This is a helper method that merges two sorted linked lists and returns the head of the merged list.

Implement the `merge_k_sorted_lists` function following the provided code snippet and guidelines.

Write a Python function named `polysum` that calculates the sum of the area and the square of the perimeter of a regular polygon. A regular polygon is a polygon with all sides and all angles equal.

The area of a regular polygon can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \times n \times s^2 \times \left(\frac{1}{\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)}\right) \]
where `n` is the number of sides and `s` is the length of each side.

The perimeter of a regular polygon is the total length of its boundary, which can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = n \times s \]

The `polysum` function should take two arguments:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (must be greater than 2).
- `s`: a float or an integer representing the length of each side of the polygon.

The function should return the sum of the area and the square of the perimeter of the regular polygon, rounded to 4 decimal places.

In the provided solution, we have three functions: `polyarea` to calculate the area of the polygon, `perimeter` to calculate the perimeter, and `polysum` to calculate the required sum. The `polysum` function also includes a check to ensure that the number of sides `n` is greater than 2, as a polygon must have at least three sides. The test cases demonstrate the usage of the `polysum` function with different numbers of sides and side lengths.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a custom permission class for a Django REST Framework API that allows access to a resource in the following manner:

- Any authenticated user can read the resource (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS).
- Only admin users (staff members) can create (POST), update (PUT, PATCH), or delete (DELETE) the resource.

The permission class should be named `AdminWritePermission`. It should inherit from `permissions.BasePermission` and override the `has_permission` method to implement the above access policy.

Write a Python script that includes the `AdminWritePermission` class and demonstrates its usage within a simple API view. The script should also include test cases that verify the correctness of the permission class for different types of users and HTTP methods.

Design a Python module that acts as a registry for various types of Arduino devices, allowing for easy addition and retrieval of device classes based on a unique identifier. The module should provide a mechanism to register device classes with a unique identifier and a way to retrieve the class associated with a given identifier. The registry should be able to handle the addition of new device types without modifying the core registry code.

Implement the following functionalities:
1. A registry class that can add and retrieve device classes.
2. A custom exception for handling registration errors.
3. A set of device classes for different Arduino devices (e.g., digital read, digital write, analog read, analog write, servo, stepper motor, temperature sensor).

Design a Python program using Pygame to create a simple game menu system with multiple menus: Main Menu, Shop Menu, Upgrades Menu, and Game Over Menu. Each menu should have buttons that the user can interact with. The Main Menu should have buttons to start the game, exit the game, go to the shop, and go to the upgrades section. The Shop Menu should allow users to browse through different in-game items (e.g., cars) and purchase them if they have enough in-game currency. The Upgrades Menu should allow users to upgrade various aspects of their in-game character or items. The Game Over Menu should be displayed when the game ends and should have an option to return to the Main Menu.

The program should handle user input for button clicks and update the display accordingly. Each button should change color when hovered over and play a sound when clicked. The Shop Menu should load item prices from a JSON file and update the user's currency after a purchase. The Upgrades Menu should display the current level of upgrades and their costs, and it should not allow upgrades beyond a maximum level.

Design a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should be implemented using an object-oriented approach where each operation is represented by a class that inherits from an abstract base class `AbstractOperation`. Each operation class should override two methods: `getAnswer`, which performs the calculation, and `getOperator`, which returns the symbol of the operation.

The abstract base class `AbstractOperation` should define the structure of the operation classes but not provide any implementation. The operation classes should be named `AddOperation`, `SubtractOperation`, `MultiplyOperation`, and `DivideOperation`.

Additionally, implement a `Calculator` class that uses these operation classes to perform calculations. The `Calculator` class should have a method `calculate` that takes three arguments: `firstNumber`, `operator`, and `secondNumber`. The `operator` argument is a string that specifies the operation to perform (e.g., ""+"", ""-"", ""*"", ""/"").

The `calculate` method should select the appropriate operation class based on the operator and use it to perform the calculation. If an invalid operator is provided, the method should raise a `ValueError`.

Write a Python function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its argument and returns `True` if the number is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The function should follow these requirements:
- It should handle input values where `n` is less than 2 by returning `False`, as these are not prime numbers.
- It should be optimized to reduce the number of iterations needed to determine if `n` is prime. For example, it only needs to check for factors up to the square root of `n`.
- Include a docstring that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

You are tasked with creating a Django administration interface for a law firm's case management system. The system should allow administrative users to manage different types of data related to legal cases, including case types, scopes, clients, lawyers, services, cases, and registrations. Each model has specific fields that need to be displayed in the admin interface and certain fields that should be searchable.

Your job is to implement custom Django `ModelAdmin` classes for each model to enhance the admin interface. The models are already defined in the `models.py` file (not provided here), and you are given the task to set up the admin interface according to the following specifications:

1. `CasesTypeAdmin` should display the fields `id` and `type`, and allow searching by `type`.
2. `ScopeAdmin` should display the fields `id` and `type`, and allow searching by `type`.
3. `ClientsAdmin` should display the fields `id`, `f_name`, `m_name`, `l_name`, `passport`, and `tel`, and allow searching by `l_name`, `passport`, and `tel`.
4. `LawyersAdmin` should display the fields `id`, `f_name`, `m_name`, `l_name`, `id_scope`, and `free`, and allow searching by `l_name` and `free`.
5. `ServicesAdmin` should display the fields `id`, `type`, and `cost`, and allow searching by `type`.
6. `CasesAdmin` should display the fields `id`, `name`, `content`, `date`, `id_client`, `id_lawyer`, `id_service`, and `id_case_type`, and allow searching by `name`, `date`, `id_client`, `id_lawyer`, `id_service`, and `id_case_type`.
7. `RegistrationAdmin` should display the fields `id`, `id_client`, `id_lawyer`, `id_service`, `id_case_type`, and `date`, and allow searching by `date`.

Write the Python code to create these `ModelAdmin` classes and register them with the Django admin site. Ensure that all necessary packages are imported at the beginning of the code snippet.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import CasesType, Scope, Clients, Lawyers, Services, Cases, Registration

admin.site.register(Services, ServicesAdmin)
admin.site.register(Cases, CasesAdmin)
admin.site.register(Registration, RegistrationAdmin)

**Test Cases**:

Since the solution involves Django admin configuration, the test cases would typically involve checking the admin interface manually to ensure that the list displays and search fields are working as expected. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that the Django models are correctly defined and focus on the registration of the `ModelAdmin` classes with the Django admin site.

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would:

1. Run the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`.
2. Navigate to the admin interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
3. Log in with an admin user account.
4. Check each of the registered models (`CasesType`, `Scope`, `Clients`, `Lawyers`, `Services`, `Cases`, `Registration`) to ensure that the specified fields are displayed in the list view and that the search functionality works as described in the specifications.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `fetch_artist_info` that retrieves information about a music artist from the Last.fm website. The function should return a dictionary containing the artist's name, a list of similar artists, and the artist's top album titles.

The function should follow these specifications:

1. The function accepts a single parameter, `artist_name`, which is a string representing the name of the artist.
2. The function constructs a URL to fetch the artist's page on Last.fm.
3. The function uses `urlopen` to retrieve the HTML content of the artist's page.
4. The function uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.
5. The function extracts the following information:
   - A list of similar artists, as found in the ""+similar"" section of the page.
   - A list of the artist's top album titles, as found in the ""Top Albums"" section of the page.
6. The function returns a dictionary with the keys `artist_name`, `similar_artists`, and `top_albums`. Each key maps to the corresponding information extracted from the page.
7. If the artist's page or specific information cannot be found, the function should handle exceptions gracefully and return a dictionary with appropriate error messages.

2. Propagation of the GMM over time using a numerical integration method (e.g., Runge-Kutta 4th order).
3. Abstract method `stepForward` that should be implemented by subclasses to define the specific evolution strategy.
4. Two subclasses, `VGMM_Fixed` and `VGMM_Fisher`, that implement the `stepForward` method for the fixed weights and Fisher information metric strategies, respectively.
5. A method to convert the GMM parameters to and from a vector representation for numerical integration purposes.

The target distribution should be an object that provides methods for evaluating the log probability density function (`logpdf`) and its gradient (`gradient`). The GMM object should provide methods for converting between the GMM parameters and a vector representation (`GMM2Vector`, `Vector2GMM`, `GMM2Vector2`, `Vector2GMM2`), as well as methods for evaluating the log probability density function (`logpdf`) and its gradient (`gradient`) of the GMM.

Write a Python program that generates a Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal wave file for a given sequence of DTMF keys. DTMF signals are used for telecommunication signaling over analog telephone lines in the voice-frequency band between telephone handsets and other communications devices and the switching center. Each key on the keypad generates a combination of two tones: one from a low-frequency group and one from a high-frequency group.

Your program should:
- Accept a sequence of DTMF keys as input.
- Generate the corresponding DTMF signal for each key in the sequence.
- Concatenate the signals with a short period of silence between each tone.
- Save the concatenated signal as a WAV file with a specified sampling frequency and duration for each tone.

The program should include the following functionalities:
- A function to map the DTMF key sequence to their corresponding index in the tone map.
- A function to check the validity of the DTMF key sequence and convert it to uppercase.
- A function to get the frequency pair (low and high) for a given DTMF key index.
- A function to apply a fade-in and fade-out effect to the signal to prevent popping sounds.
- A function to generate the signal for a given duration, frequencies, and sampling rate.
- Command-line argument parsing to accept the sampling frequency, duration of the tone, and the DTMF key sequence.

The program should also handle invalid DTMF key sequences by raising an appropriate error.

Design a web application using Flask that allows users to register, log in, view their profile, edit their profile, and log out. The application should have the following features:

1. A registration page where new users can create an account by providing a username, email, password, first name, and last name. The password should be hashed before being stored in the database.
2. A login page where users can log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, the user should be redirected to their profile page or to a previously attempted URL if one was saved in the session.
3. A profile page that displays the user's username, email, first name, and last name. If the logged-in user is viewing their own profile, they should have the option to edit their profile.
4. An edit profile page that allows users to update their username, email, first name, and last name. The application should check for the uniqueness of the new username and email before updating the user's information.
5. A logout functionality that logs the user out and redirects them to the login page.

The application should handle errors appropriately, such as displaying an error message for incorrect login credentials, attempting to use an already taken username or email during registration or profile editing, and handling non-existent user profiles.

Create a simple web application using Flask that displays a list of the top five directors. The application should have two routes: the home route (`/`) and the directors route (`/directors`). The home route should display a welcome message along with the title ""Top Five Directors"". The directors route should display a list of the top five directors' names.

The application should use Flask's `render_template` function to render HTML templates. You will need to create two HTML templates: `home.html` and `directors.html`. The `home.html` template should display the welcome message and title, while the `directors.html` template should display the list of directors.

The list of directors should be passed to the `directors.html` template as a dictionary from the Flask view function. Each director's name should be associated with a unique key in the dictionary.

Write the Flask application code and the corresponding HTML templates. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the application routes.

Design a Python class named `EmotionPerceptron` that simulates a simple artificial neuron for emotion recognition. The perceptron should be able to process input signals, apply an activation function, and adjust its weights based on the error in prediction. The perceptron will be used in a larger neural network for classifying emotions from image data, where each image is represented as a flattened array of pixel intensity values.

The `EmotionPerceptron` class should have the following features:

1. An `__init__` method that initializes the perceptron with a list of weights and a string representing the emotion it is associated with.
2. An `activation_function` method that takes a list of inputs (pixel values) and computes the perceptron's output using the sigmoid activation function. The pixel values are assumed to be integers in the range [0, 255], and they should be normalized by dividing by 32 before applying the weights.
3. An `update_weights` method that adjusts the perceptron's weights based on an array of weight updates (delta values).
4. Getter methods for the weights, output, and emotion associated with the perceptron.

The class should be well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose and usage of each method.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have a running server that echoes messages. Assuming such a server is running, you can test the client as follows:

1. Run the client program and connect to the server.
2. Send a message and verify that the server echoes it back.
3. Send multiple messages and verify that each is echoed back correctly.
4. Type 'exit' to disconnect and ensure the client program terminates gracefully.
5. Attempt to connect to a server that is not running to test the exception handling for `ConnectionRefusedError`.
6. Disconnect the server during a session to test the exception handling for `ConnectionResetError`.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a function that converts a given Binary Search Tree (BST) into a Circular Doubly Linked List. Each node in the BST has a `val` attribute, as well as `left` and `right` pointers to its children. The function should maintain the original left-to-right order of the nodes in the BST. The left pointer of the first node should point to the last node, and the right pointer of the last node should point to the first node, thus making it circular.

The function should have the following signature:

Design a Django REST framework API for a user management system where `HUser` represents a user model. The system should allow for user registration and user profile updates. The API should have two separate viewsets: `HUserViewSet` for registration and `HUserEditViewSet` for profile updates.

The `HUserViewSet` should handle user registration with the following requirements:
- The endpoint should accept `POST` requests for creating new users.
- The user data should be validated using the `HUserRegisterSerializer`.
- If the data is valid, a new `HUser` should be created and a response with HTTP status 201 (Created) should be returned along with the user data.
- If the data is invalid, a response with HTTP status 400 (Bad Request) should be returned along with the error details.

The `HUserEditViewSet` should handle user profile updates with the following requirements:
- The endpoint should accept `PUT` requests for updating existing user profiles.
- The user data should be validated using the `HUserUpdateSerializer`.
- If the data is valid, the corresponding `HUser` should be updated and a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) should be returned along with the updated user data.
- If the data is invalid, a response with HTTP status 400 (Bad Request) should be returned along with the error details.
- The `PUT` request should only be allowed if the user is authenticated and is the owner of the profile being updated. This should be enforced using the `IsHUserOwner` permission.

Implement the `HUserViewSet` and `HUserEditViewSet` classes following the above requirements. Ensure that you handle permissions correctly for each action. You can assume that the `HUser` model, `IsHUserOwner` permission, and the serializers `HUserRegisterSerializer` and `HUserUpdateSerializer` are already implemented.

Write a Python program that simulates a simple amino acid property quiz for a biochemistry student. The program should ask the user (student) for their student ID and use it to seed the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of the quiz for each student.

The solution includes a function `digit_power_sum` that uses list comprehension to iterate over each digit, convert it to an integer, raise it to the power, and sum the results. The test cases verify the correctness of the solution.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Implement a custom data augmentation pipeline for object detection tasks using Detectron2. The pipeline should include a custom mapper function that applies a series of random transformations to the input images and their corresponding annotations. The transformations should include random background replacement, random brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments, random rotations, flips, and cropping. Additionally, the pipeline should resize the images to a fixed size.

The custom mapper function should be integrated into a custom trainer class that extends Detectron2's `DefaultTrainer`. The trainer should override the `build_train_loader` method to use the custom mapper and the `build_evaluator` method to create appropriate evaluators based on the dataset type.

Provide a complete Python code snippet that defines the custom mapper function and the custom trainer class. Ensure that the code snippet includes all necessary imports and that it is self-contained and clear. After the code snippet, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Design a class `NearestNeighborPlanning` that performs a nearest neighbor search to predict a sequence of class labels for a given input sequence. The class should be a subclass of a hypothetical `BaseModel` class and should use a custom `MultiLabelCrossEntropyLoss` for its loss function. The model is designed to work with a dataset that provides sequences of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data, and the goal is to predict a subsequence of class labels based on the nearest neighbors in the training set.

The class should have the following characteristics:

1. It should accept an `args` object in its constructor with the following attributes:
   - `dataset.CLASS_WEIGHTS`: A tensor of class weights for the loss function.
   - `imus`: A list of indices for the IMU data to be used.
   - `planning_distance`: The length of the subsequence to predict.
   - `sequence_length`: The total length of the input sequences.
   - `train_loader`: A data loader for the training data.
   - `num_classes`: The number of distinct class labels.

2. The `forward` method should take an `input` tensor representing a batch of input sequences and a `target` tensor representing the corresponding ground truth labels. The method should perform the following steps:
   - Verify that the model is not in training mode, as the forward pass is not defined for training.
   - Extract subsequences from the input based on the `planning_distance` and concatenate them.
   - For each input sequence, find the training sequence with the minimum distance and use its labels as the prediction.
   - Return the predicted labels, the ground truth labels for the predicted subsequence, and the indices of the predicted labels in the original sequence.

3. The `loss` method should return an instance of `MultiLabelCrossEntropyLoss` initialized with the class weights.

4. The `learning_rate` method should return a learning rate based on the current epoch, with a predefined schedule.

Write a function `max_product_subarray` that takes a list of integers `nums` and returns the largest product that can be obtained from a contiguous subarray of `nums`. The subarray must contain at least one number.

The function should handle the following cases:
- If `nums` is empty, the function should return 0.
- If `nums` contains both positive and negative numbers, the function should find the subarray that maximizes the product, taking into account that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.
- If `nums` contains zeros, the function should treat the zero as a separator that divides the array into subarrays, since the product of any subarray containing zero will be zero.

Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of integers, stores them in a list, and provides a summary of the list once the user decides to stop entering numbers. The program should have the following features:

1. The user can enter as many integers as they wish, one at a time.
2. After each integer is entered, the program should display the current list of numbers.
3. The user can stop entering numbers by typing 'N' when asked if they want to continue.
4. Once the user stops entering numbers, the program should display the total count of numbers entered.
5. The program should then display the list in descending order.
6. The program should check if the number 5 is in the list:
    - If the number 5 is present, the program should display how many times it occurs, its first position in the list, and all the positions where it occurs.
    - If the number 5 is not present, the program should indicate that it was not found.
7. Finally, the program should print the current date when the process is completed.

The program should use colored output to enhance readability:
- Use yellow color for highlighting numbers and messages.
- Use red color for the message indicating that the number 5 was not found.
- Reset to default color after each colored message.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can run the program and test the following scenarios:

1. Enter a sequence of numbers including the number 5 and choose to stop entering numbers. Verify that the summary correctly displays the total count, the list in descending order, and the occurrences of the number 5.
2. Enter a sequence of numbers without the number 5 and choose to stop entering numbers. Verify that the summary correctly displays the total count, the list in descending order, and the message indicating that the number 5 was not found.
3. Enter invalid inputs when prompted to continue (e.g., letters other than 'Y' or 'N') and verify that the program asks again until a valid response is given.

Note: Since this program requires user input, it cannot be fully automated for testing without simulating user input, which is beyond the scope of this example.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a simplified model of our solar system, we want to simulate the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Earth, and Jupiter. The simulation should take into account the initial positions and velocities of these celestial bodies, and it should be able to adjust the mass of Jupiter to study its effect on the system's dynamics.

The simulation will be run for a specified number of years, with a given number of steps per year. The user should have the option to freeze the Sun's position, use a two-body approximation, apply relativistic corrections, and save the results periodically. Additionally, the simulation should be able to find the perihelion precession of the planets if required.

The task is to implement a Python class `JupiterRunner` that extends a given `Runner` class (not provided in the snippet) and includes the following features:

1. A `setup` method to initialize the simulation parameters.
2. A `project_positions` method to adjust the initial positions and velocities of the bodies such that the total angular momentum of the system is zero and all bodies lie in the x-y plane.
3. A `run` method to execute the simulation with different mass multipliers for Jupiter and to print the simulation results, including the time taken to run the simulation.
4. The ability to plot the 2D trajectory of the bodies after the simulation.

The `Runner` class is assumed to have methods like `get_planet`, `run_simulation`, `extract_time`, and `run_analysis` to interact with the simulation environment.

**Test Cases**:

Since the `Runner` class and its methods are not provided, we cannot write actual test cases. However, if they were available, test cases would involve creating an instance of `JupiterRunner`, calling the `setup` method, and then the `run` method to ensure that the simulation runs as expected with different mass multipliers for Jupiter. The output should be verified for correctness, including the simulation time and the generated plots.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function named `load_config` that reads a JSON configuration file and returns the configuration data as a dictionary. The function should handle common exceptions that may occur during file reading and JSON parsing, such as `FileNotFoundError` if the file does not exist, and `json.JSONDecodeError` if the file is not a valid JSON.

The function should have the following signature:

```python
def load_config(filepath: str) -> dict:
    """"""
    Reads a JSON configuration file and returns the configuration data as a dictionary.

    - filepath (str): The path to the JSON configuration file.

Design a Python class `Panel` that represents a genomic panel, which is a collection of genetic variants within a specific region of the genome. The class should be able to read variants from a VCF (Variant Call Format) file and provide the alleles (reference and alternative) for a given chromosome and position.

The `Panel` class should have the following features:

1. Initialization with a VCF file path and optional parameters `left_range` and `right_range` that define the range of positions to consider around a given position when fetching alleles.

2. A method `get_alleles(chrom, position)` that returns the alleles for a given chromosome (`chrom`) and position (`position`). If the position is outside the current range or on a different chromosome, the method should update the range and fetch the relevant variants from the VCF file.

3. The class should use the `pysam` library to read the VCF file and the `contextlib` library to ensure that file handles are properly closed after use.

4. The alleles should be returned as a namedtuple `Alleles` with fields `ref` for the reference allele and `alt` for a set of alternative alleles.

5. If no variant is found at the given position, the method should return `None`.

Design a Python program that extracts and stores feature descriptors from a batch of images using different keypoint detection and descriptor extraction algorithms. The program should be able to process two separate sets of images: thumbnails and test images. It should support multiple feature extraction algorithms, including KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, and BRISK. The extracted features for each image should be saved in a serialized format using pickle, with separate files for thumbnails and test images corresponding to each algorithm.

The program should follow these steps:
1. Read images from specified directories for thumbnails and test images.
2. For each image, use the provided feature extraction algorithm to detect keypoints and compute descriptors.
3. Handle any errors that occur during feature extraction.
4. Store the descriptors in a dictionary with the image file name as the key.
5. Serialize the dictionary and save it to a specified pickle file for each set of images and algorithm.
6. Provide a main function that orchestrates the feature extraction process for all combinations of image sets and algorithms.

You are tasked with creating a secure authentication system for a web application using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The system should be able to generate a token for a user with a given email address, decode the token to retrieve user information, and handle exceptions if the token is invalid or expired. Additionally, the system should be able to read a description from a file, falling back to a default description if the file cannot be read.

Implement the following functionalities:

1. `create_token(email: str) -> dict[str, str]`: Generates a JWT for the given email address. The token should expire after a predefined number of hours (`JWT_EXP_HOURS`). The token should be encoded using a secret key (`JWT_SECRET`) and an algorithm (`JWT_ALGO`).

2. `decode_token(access_token: str) -> dict[str, str]`: Decodes the given JWT and returns the user data. If the token is invalid or expired, it should raise an `HTTPException` with status code 401 (Unauthorized).

3. `read_from_file(filename: str) -> str`: Reads and returns the content of the given file. If the file cannot be read, it should print an error message and return an empty string.

4. `get_description() -> str`: Returns the application description. It should attempt to read the description from a file (`README_FILE`). If the file cannot be read, it should return a default description (`API_DESCRIPTION`).

Write a Python script that implements the above functionalities, including the necessary imports. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of each function.

Write a Python program that reads a phylogenetic tree in Nexus format and a tab-delimited CSV file containing metadata for the samples in the tree. The program should annotate the tree with the metadata from the CSV file and output the annotated tree in Nexus format.

The CSV file contains a header row with the names of the metadata fields, and each subsequent row corresponds to a sample with its metadata. The first column of the CSV file is labeled 'SampleID' and contains unique identifiers for the samples, which match the names of the clades in the phylogenetic tree.

The program should:
- Read the Nexus file and the CSV file provided as command-line arguments.
- Parse the CSV file and store the metadata for each sample.
- Traverse the phylogenetic tree and for each clade with a name that matches a 'SampleID' in the CSV file, annotate the clade with the corresponding metadata.
- Output the annotated phylogenetic tree in Nexus format to standard output.

Metadata should be added to the clades as comments in the format `&key=""value""`, where `key` is the name of the metadata field and `value` is the corresponding value for the sample. The keys should be sorted alphabetically, and the 'SampleID' key should be excluded from the annotations.

Write a Python function `compare_finite_element_basis` that compares the basis functions of finite elements between the SymFEM and Basix libraries for a given element type, cell type, and order. The function should take the following parameters:

- `cell_type`: A string representing the type of cell (e.g., ""interval"", ""triangle"", ""tetrahedron"", etc.).
- `element_type`: A string representing the type of finite element (e.g., ""Lagrange"", ""Serendipity"", ""Bubble"", etc.).
- `order`: An integer representing the order of the finite element.
- `variant_args`: A list of tuples representing additional arguments for the element variant (e.g., [(""LagrangeVariant"", ""equispaced"")]).

The function should create a lattice of points for the given cell type, instantiate the finite element in both SymFEM and Basix, tabulate the basis functions at the lattice points, and compare the results. If the basis functions agree within a tolerance, the function should return `True`, otherwise `False`.

The function should handle any exceptions or errors that arise due to missing libraries, unsupported element types, or other issues, and return `False` in such cases.

Design a Django model for a user management system that supports different types of users with varying permissions and active statuses. The system should be able to filter users based on their type and whether they are active. Implement custom model managers to handle these filters. Additionally, the user model should include fields for the user's full name, email, and a unique slug generated for each user. The slug should be generated only once when the user is created. The user model should also have methods to check permissions, get the user's short name, full name, and URLs for various user-related actions.

Ensure that the user model has the following characteristics:
- Different user types such as Administrator, Nurse, Doctor, and Technician.
- Custom managers to filter active users of each type, as well as combined types like active Nurses and Technicians.
- A method to generate a unique slug for each user upon creation.
- Methods to return the user's full name, short name, and URLs for updating, deleting, and activating the user's registration.
- Properties to check if the user is staff (only Administrators are staff) and to get the user's first name.

Write a Django model that fulfills the above requirements and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the custom managers and methods.

Design a Python class named `AlienInvasionSettings` that encapsulates the settings for a hypothetical arcade-style game called ""Alien Invasion"". The game features a spaceship that the player controls to defend against waves of incoming aliens. The player can shoot bullets to destroy the aliens and earn points. The game's difficulty increases over time by speeding up the ship, bullets, and aliens, as well as increasing the points earned for each alien destroyed.

The `AlienInvasionSettings` class should include the following features:

1. Initialization of static settings for the game, such as screen dimensions, background color, ship's initial speed and lives, bullet's initial speed, dimensions, color, and the maximum number of bullets allowed on the screen at once.

2. Initialization of dynamic settings that can change as the game progresses, such as the ship's speed, bullet's speed, alien's speed, and the initial score for each alien destroyed.

3. A method to increase the game's speed and the score for each alien destroyed. This method should be called each time a new wave of aliens is defeated to make the game more challenging.

4. The class should also handle the direction of the alien fleet's movement, with a property that indicates whether the fleet is moving right or left.

Implement the class with appropriate attributes and methods, and provide a docstring for each method explaining its purpose.

Design a Federated Learning algorithm that trains a machine learning model across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. The algorithm should include gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients during client updates. The algorithm should be implemented using TensorFlow Federated (TFF) and TensorFlow (TF).

The algorithm should consist of the following components:
1. A function to initialize the model weights.
2. A client update function that performs local training on each client's dataset, applies gradient clipping, and returns the updated model weights and the number of examples processed.
3. A server update function that aggregates the client updates and updates the server model.
4. A federated learning process that orchestrates the initialization, client updates, and server updates.

The client update function should use a client optimizer that is chosen based on the task being solved (e.g., 'emnist/mnist' or 'cifar10'). The server update function should use a fixed learning rate.

Provide a complete implementation of the federated learning algorithm, including the necessary TensorFlow and TensorFlow Federated imports. Also, include test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

The node should be configurable to adjust the video playback speed, scale the image size, and optionally loop the video indefinitely. The node should handle the case where the video file path is invalid or the file cannot be opened.

The node should be named `video_publisher` and should publish to the `/image` topic. The node should use the following ROS parameters:
- `video_path`: The file path to the video that should be published.
- `loop`: A boolean indicating whether the video should loop indefinitely. If `False`, the video should be published once and the node should shut down.
- `scale`: A float representing the factor by which the image size should be scaled. A value of 1.0 means no scaling, less than 1.0 means downscaling, and greater than 1.0 means upscaling.
- `fps`: The frames per second at which the video should be published. If `None`, the original video's FPS should be used.

The node should use the `cv_bridge` package to convert OpenCV images to ROS Image messages. It should also handle any exceptions that may occur during the video processing and publishing, such as `CvBridgeError` or issues with the video capture.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can run the following test cases after setting up the necessary ROS environment and parameters:

1. Test with a valid video file path, no loop, default scale, and default FPS:
   - Set the `video_path` parameter to a valid video file.
   - Set the `loop` parameter to `False`.
   - Do not set the `scale` and `fps` parameters (they should use default values).
   - Run the node and observe that the video frames are published once to the `/image` topic.

2. Test with a valid video file path, loop enabled, scale down, and custom FPS:
   - Set the `video_path` parameter to a valid video file.
   - Set the `loop` parameter to `True`.
   - Set the `scale` parameter to a value less than 1.0 (e.g., 0.5).
   - Set the `fps` parameter to a custom value (e.g., 15).
   - Run the node and observe that the video frames are published indefinitely to the `/image` topic with the specified scale and FPS.

3. Test with an invalid video file path:
   - Set the `video_path` parameter to an invalid or non-existent video file.
   - Run the node and observe that an error message is logged and the node does not crash.

Please note that these test cases assume that you have a ROS environment set up and that you have a video file available for testing.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function `update_course` that updates the title and URL of an existing course in a mock REST API. The function should take three parameters: `course_id`, `new_title`, and `new_url`. It should perform the following steps:

1. Send a GET request to retrieve the current course information from the mock API endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/v2/cursos/{course_id}/`.
2. Verify that the course with the given `course_id` exists by checking the status code of the GET request response. If the course does not exist, raise a `ValueError` with the message ""Course not found"".
3. Update the course information by sending a PUT request with the new title and URL to the same endpoint.
4. Check the status code of the PUT request response to ensure that the update was successful. If the status code is not 200, raise an `Exception` with the message ""Failed to update course"".
5. Return the updated course information as a dictionary.

The function should use the provided `headers` for authorization and should handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the HTTP requests.

Create a Python Flask web application that serves as a library management system. The application should have two routes: one for displaying all books in the library and another for displaying all books from a specific publisher. The application should use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

The database has two tables: `Book` and `Publication`. The `Book` table has fields for `id`, `title`, `author`, and `pub_id` (which is a foreign key to the `Publication` table). The `Publication` table has fields for `id` and `name`.

The Flask application should have the following two routes:

1. `/` - This route should display a list of all books in the library. Each book's details should include its title and author.
2. `/display/publisher/<publisher_id>` - This route should display all books from a specific publisher. It should show the publisher's name and a list of all books published by that publisher, including the title and author of each book.

The application should use `render_template` to render HTML pages for both routes. The HTML templates `home.html` and `publisher.html` are already created and should be used to display the books and publisher information, respectively.

","

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///library.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Book(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    author = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    pub_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('publication.id'), nullable=False)

class Publication(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    books = db.relationship('Book', backref='publication', lazy=True)

@app.route('/')
def display_books():
    books = Book.query.all()
    return render_template('home.html', books=books)

@app.route('/display/publisher/<int:publisher_id>')
def display_publisher(publisher_id):
    publisher = Publication.query.get_or_404(publisher_id)
    publisher_books = Book.query.filter_by(pub_id=publisher.id).all()
    return render_template('publisher.html', publisher=publisher, publisher_books=publisher_books)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # Create tables if they don't exist
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To verify the correctness of the solution, you would need to have the `home.html` and `publisher.html` templates created in the `templates` directory of your Flask application. Additionally, you would need to populate the database with some `Book` and `Publication` records to test the routes.

Here's an example of how the `home.html` and `publisher.html` templates might look:

`home.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Library Home</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>All Books</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for book in books %}
            <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

`publisher.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Publisher Books</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Books by {{ publisher.name }}</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for book in publisher_books %}
            <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Remember that in a real-world scenario, you would also need to handle cases where the database is empty or the requested publisher does not exist. The `get_or_404` method used in the `display_publisher` function is a Flask-SQLAlchemy method that will return a 404 error if the requested `Publication` is not found.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Implement a Python class `LedgerCtap2` that extends the functionality of the `Ctap2` class from the `fido2.ctap2.base` module. The `LedgerCtap2` class is designed to interact with a hardware device that supports FIDO2 operations and provides additional methods to handle user interactions with the device's screen and buttons during command exchange.

The class should include the following methods:

1. `__init__(self, device, model, navigator, ctap2_u2f_proxy, debug=False)`: Initializes the `LedgerCtap2` instance with the given parameters.

2. `confirm(self)`: Sends a navigation instruction to the device to confirm an action by clicking both buttons.

3. `wait_for_return_on_dashboard(self)`: Waits for the device to return to the home screen.

4. `send_cbor_nowait(self, cmd, data=None, *, event=None, on_keepalive=None)`: Sends a CBOR command to the device without waiting for a response.

5. `send_cbor(self, cmd, data=None, *, event=None, on_keepalive=None)`: Sends a CBOR command to the device and waits for a response.

6. `parse_response(self, response)`: Parses the response from the device and raises appropriate exceptions for errors.

7. `make_credential(...)`: Sends a `make_credential` command to the device and handles user interactions for the registration process.

8. `get_assertion(...)`: Sends a `get_assertion` command to the device and handles user interactions for the authentication process.

9. `reset(...)`: Sends a `reset` command to the device and handles user interactions for the reset process.

The class should also handle the encapsulation of CBOR messages in U2F APDU when `ctap2_u2f_proxy` is `True`.

Design a Python Django web application that provides various forms to interact with a competitive programming platform. The application should allow users to search for coding problems, analyze user profiles, calculate rating changes after contests, find the average gap between contest participations for a user, and compare two users' performances in a specific contest. Additionally, implement a form to generate a problem ladder for a user based on the number of problems they want to practice.

The application should include the following forms:

1. `code_search_form`: To search for a specific problem using a user's name, contest code, and question code.
2. `analyse_profile_form`: To analyze a user's profile based on their username.
3. `rating_change_calculator`: To calculate the expected rating change for a user after a contest based on their old rating, rank, and contest code.
4. `average_gap_form`: To calculate the average gap (in days) between contest participations for a user.
5. `compare_contest_form`: To compare the performance of two users in a specific contest using their usernames and the contest code.
6. `ladder_form`: To generate a problem ladder for a user, which is a list of problems to practice, based on the user's name and the number of problems they want to include in the ladder.

Write a Python function `make_change` that simulates a change-making machine. The function should take an amount of US currency in cents and return a dictionary that shows the least amount of coins used to make up that amount. The coin denominations considered in this exercise are: Pennies (1¢), Nickels (5¢), Dimes (10¢), Quarters (25¢), and Half-Dollars (50¢). Therefore, the dictionary returned should contain exactly 5 key/value pairs.

The function should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. If the function is passed either 0 or a negative number, it should return the dictionary with all values equal to 0.
2. If a float is passed into the function, its value should be rounded down, and the resulting dictionary should never contain fractions of a coin.
3. The function should always return the combination with the least number of coins possible.

Example usage:

```python
make_change(56)  # -> {'Pennies': 1, 'Nickels': 1, 'Dimes': 0, 'Quarters': 2, 'Half-Dollars': 0}
make_change(-435)  # -> {'Pennies': 0, 'Nickels': 0, 'Dimes': 0, 'Quarters': 0, 'Half-Dollars': 0}
make_change(4.935)  # -> {'Pennies': 4, 'Nickels': 0, 'Dimes': 0, 'Quarters': 0, 'Half-Dollars': 0}

Design a Python class `WorkflowSyncer` that interacts with a hypothetical CircleCI API to synchronize workflow data for a given project. The class should be able to handle incremental data fetching, resuming synchronization after interruptions, and storing state information between runs. The CircleCI API provides workflow data for pipelines, and each workflow has a unique ID and a creation timestamp.

The class should implement the following methods:

1. `__init__(self, client, project)`: Initializes the `WorkflowSyncer` with a given API client and project identifier.
2. `get_pipelines(self)`: Fetches pipeline IDs associated with the project and returns them as a list.
3. `get_records(self, pipeline_id, bookmark_date)`: Fetches workflow records for a given pipeline ID starting from the `bookmark_date`. It should handle pagination if the API response includes a `next_page_token`.
4. `sync(self)`: Orchestrates the synchronization process, fetching workflows incrementally and updating the state accordingly. It should log the progress and handle interruptions gracefully, allowing the process to resume from where it left off.

The class should also handle the following:

- Use the `created_at` field as the replication key for incremental data fetching.
- Store the last successfully fetched pipeline ID and the maximum `created_at` timestamp seen so far in the state.
- Log warnings if the synchronization was previously interrupted.
- Transform and write records using the provided `Transformer` and `write_record` functions.
- Update the state after each pipeline's workflows are fetched using the `write_state` function.

Write a Python program that finds the maximum value in a list of integers and its position within the list. The program should take 9 integers as input from the user, store them in a list, and then print the maximum value along with its position in the list (1-based index).

The output should be in the following format:
```
Maximum value: <max_value>
Position: <position>
```

Where `<max_value>` is the maximum integer in the list and `<position>` is the 1-based index of the maximum value in the list.

Design a Django application model structure for a school management system that includes user profiles with different roles, teachers, students, and parents. The system should be able to handle user roles, associate teachers with schools, students with schools and courses, and link parents to their children who are students.

The `Profile` model should extend Django's `AbstractUser` to include additional fields such as `role` and `phone_number`. The `role` field should be a choice field that includes the following options: 'Admin', 'Moderator', 'Teacher', 'Student', and 'Parent'. The `phone_number` field should be a character field with a default value and the option to be left blank or null.

The `Teacher` model should have a one-to-one relationship with the `Profile` model and a many-to-many relationship with a `School` model (which is assumed to be defined in a separate 'school' app within the project).

The `Student` model should also have a one-to-one relationship with the `Profile` model, a foreign key to a `School` model, and a many-to-many relationship with a `Course` model (which is also assumed to be defined in the 'school' app).

The `Parent` model should have a one-to-one relationship with the `Profile` model and a foreign key to the `Student` model, allowing for the association of a parent with their child.

Implement the models with appropriate `__str__` methods for string representation and ensure that all necessary imports are included at the beginning of the code snippet. Provide test cases to verify the correctness of the model relationships.

A city's public transportation system is managed by a software system that regularly updates various aspects of the transit network. The system updates route information, route maps, station information, and stop information. These updates are performed by calling specific functions from a module named `Data_Updater`.

Your task is to write a Python script that automates the update process for the transit network. The script should perform the following actions:

1. Update the route information by calling the `RouteInfo_Updater` function.
2. Update the route maps by calling the `RouteMap_Updater` function.
3. Update the station information by calling the `StationInfo_Updater` function.
4. Update the stop information by calling the `StopInfo_Updater` function.

Each updater function should print a message indicating that the update has been completed successfully. For example, the `RouteInfo_Updater` function should print ""Route information updated successfully.""

Additionally, the script should handle any exceptions that may occur during the update process and print an appropriate error message without stopping the execution of the remaining updates.

","

```python
# Assuming the Data_Updater module and its functions are defined elsewhere and imported here.

In this solution, we define a function `update_transit_network` that calls each updater function inside a try-except block. This ensures that any exceptions raised during the update process are caught and handled appropriately, allowing the script to continue executing the remaining updates. After each successful update, a confirmation message is printed. If an error occurs, an error message is printed with the details of the exception.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Design a Python application that utilizes the provided `AssetModel` and `MatchModel` classes to manage and display a collection of assets and their corresponding matches in a graphical user interface (GUI). The application should allow users to add new assets, display them in a list, and mark certain assets as ""linked"" to visually distinguish them from others.

The `AssetModel` class is used to represent a list of assets, each with a label and an optional icon. The `MatchModel` class extends `AssetModel` to include functionality for marking assets as linked based on an index.

Your task is to create a GUI application using the PyQt framework that includes the following features:

1. A main window with two list views: one for displaying assets and another for displaying matches.
2. Buttons to add new assets to the asset list and matches to the match list.
3. The ability to select an asset from the asset list and mark it as linked in the match list. Linked assets should be displayed in italics and bold font.

Write a Python program that processes audio files within a directory structure, applying noise reduction to each file and saving the processed files to a new directory structure that mirrors the original one. The program should be able to handle a specific range of subdirectories, each containing multiple class directories with audio files.

The directory structure is as follows:
- The root directory is divided into two modes: `vox1_dev_wav` and `vox1_test_wav`.
- Each mode contains subdirectories named with a specific pattern based on their index (e.g., `id1001`, `id1002`, ..., `id1128`).
- Each subdirectory contains class directories.
- Each class directory contains audio files.

The program should:
- Skip processing for subdirectories with indices between 270 and 309.
- Create a new root directory for the processed files, maintaining the same structure as the original.
- Apply a noise reduction function `reduce_noise1` to each audio file.
- Print the subdirectory name and the count of processed files within that subdirectory.

# Assuming the `reduce_noise` module is available and `reduce_noise1` function is implemented.
# process_audio_files(""F:/文件/vox_data/"", ""F:/文件/vox_data_noise_reduction/"")
```

**Test Cases**:

Since the `reduce_noise1` function is assumed to be implemented in the `reduce_noise` module, and the actual file processing involves file system operations, the test cases would be more about integration testing rather than unit testing. Therefore, you would need to set up a test environment with the appropriate directory structure and audio files to test the function.

However, you can test the path generation and directory skipping logic with the following pseudo-test:

```python
# Pseudo-test to verify path generation and directory skipping logic
def test_path_generation_and_skipping():
    for i in range(1, 129):
        if 270 <= i < 310:
            print(f""Skipping subdirectory with index: {i}"")
        else:
            mode = ""vox1_test_wav"" if i > 269 else ""vox1_dev_wav""
            sub_path = f""id1{'0' * (3 - len(str(i)))}{i}""
            print(f""Processing subdirectory: {sub_path} in mode: {mode}"")

test_path_generation_and_skipping()
```

This pseudo-test would print out the subdirectories that are being processed and those that are skipped, allowing you to verify that the logic is working as expected.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Implement a Sudoku solver using the breadth-first search algorithm.

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called ""boxes"", ""blocks"", or ""regions"") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

Given a partially filled Sudoku grid, your task is to complete the grid in such a way that it meets the Sudoku requirements. You should implement the `actions`, `result`, and `goal_test` methods of the `Problem` class to achieve this. The `breadth_first_search` function should be used to find the solution.

The initial state of the Sudoku puzzle will be provided as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the puzzle, and a 0 value represents an empty cell that needs to be filled.

# Define the size of the Sudoku puzzle

    def expand(self, problem):
        return [Node(child.state, self) for child in problem.result(self.state)]

# Example of a Sudoku puzzle (0 represents empty cells)
initial_state = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]

# Create a problem instance with the initial state
sudoku_problem = Problem(initial_state)

# Solve the Sudoku puzzle using breadth-first search
solution = breadth_first_search(sudoku_problem)

# Display the solution if it exists
if solution:
    display(solution.state)
else:
    print(""No solution found."")
```

In the above code, the `actions`, `result`, and `goal_test` methods of the `Problem` class are left as placeholders for you to implement. The `breadth_first_search` function is used to find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle, and the `display` function is used to print the Sudoku grid in a human-readable format. The `initial_state` variable contains a sample Sudoku puzzle that you can use to test your implementation.",Python,McEval-Instruct

In a Django web application, you are tasked with creating an admin interface for managing `Rating` objects. Each `Rating` object is associated with an `Article` and a `User` who rated the article. The `Rating` model has the following fields: `article` (a foreign key to the `Article` model), `rated_by` (a foreign key to the `User` model), and `value` (an integer representing the rating value).

Your task is to enhance the admin interface for the `Rating` model by implementing the following features:

1. Display the list of ratings with the following columns: `article`, `rated_by`, and `value`.
2. Add a search bar to allow admins to search for ratings based on the `article` title and the username of the `rated_by` user.
3. Enable filtering of ratings by `value` using a range filter in the sidebar.
4. Add a custom action to reset the `value` of selected ratings to a default value of 0.

Write the Django admin customization code to implement these features, and provide test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.

","

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.admin import SimpleListFilter
from .models import Rating, Article, User

class ValueRangeFilter(SimpleListFilter):
    title = 'rating value'
    parameter_name = 'value_range'

    def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
        return (
            ('0-2', '0-2'),
            ('3-5', '3-5'),
        )

    def queryset(self, request, queryset):
        if self.value() == '0-2':
            return queryset.filter(value__range=(0, 2))
        if self.value() == '3-5':
            return queryset.filter(value__range=(3, 5))
        return queryset

class RatingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = [""article"", ""rated_by"", ""value""]
    search_fields = [""article__title"", ""rated_by__username""]
    list_filter = (ValueRangeFilter,)

    actions = ['reset_values']

    def reset_values(self, request, queryset):
        queryset.update(value=0)
    reset_values.short_description = ""Reset selected ratings to 0""

admin.site.register(Rating, RatingAdmin)
```

Test cases to verify the solution:

Since Django admin classes are not typically tested with unit tests, and their functionality is verified through manual testing in the web interface, providing test cases in the traditional sense is not applicable. However, you can manually test the admin interface by following these steps:

1. Log in to the Django admin panel.
2. Navigate to the `Rating` section.
3. Verify that the list of ratings displays the `article`, `rated_by`, and `value` columns.
4. Use the search bar to search for ratings by `article` title or `rated_by` username.
5. Use the `Value Range` filter in the sidebar to filter ratings by their value.
6. Select one or more ratings, choose the `Reset selected ratings to 0` action from the dropdown, and click 'Go' to reset their values to 0.

Please note that the above code assumes the existence of `Rating`, `Article`, and `User` models with the appropriate fields and relationships.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a Python function named `process_string` that takes a single string argument and processes it according to the following rules:

1. The function should remove all vowels from the string. Vowels are defined as the characters 'a', 'o', 'y', 'e', 'u', and 'i' (both uppercase and lowercase).
2. After removing the vowels, the function should append a period ('.') before each remaining character and convert the character to lowercase.
3. The function should return the processed string.

For example, given the input string ""Tour"", the function should return "".t.r"" after removing the vowels 'o' and 'u', and appending periods before 't' and 'r'.

Additionally, write a main block that reads a string from a file named ""in.txt"" if it exists, processes the string using the `process_string` function, and writes the result to a file named ""out.txt"". If ""in.txt"" does not exist, the program should read the string from standard input (usually the keyboard) and print the result to standard output (usually the screen).

Write a Python class named `GCCalculator` that calculates the GC content of a given DNA sequence. The GC content is the percentage of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C), which are known for their three hydrogen bonds and contribute to the stability of the DNA molecule.

The class should have the following features:

1. A method `calculate_gc_content(sequence)` that takes a string `sequence` representing a DNA sequence and returns the GC content as a percentage. The method should be case-insensitive and should handle sequences containing characters other than 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' by ignoring them in the calculation.

2. The method should return a float rounded to two decimal places.

3. If the provided sequence is empty or contains no 'G' or 'C' characters, the method should return 0.0.

Write a function called `product_except_self` that takes a list of integers `nums` and returns a list of the products of all the numbers in the list except the number at that index. The solution should not use division and should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

For example, given the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the expected output would be `[24, 12, 8, 6]`. This is because:

Design a Python function `create_notification` that takes three parameters: `notification_text`, `notification_date`, and `notification_time`. The function should create an instance of the `Notification` model (as defined in the given code snippet) and save it to the database. The `Notification` model represents a simple notification system where each notification has an ID, a text message, a date, and a time.

The function should perform the following tasks:
1. Validate that `notification_text` is a string with a maximum length of 100 characters. If the text exceeds this length, the function should raise a `ValueError`.
2. Validate that `notification_date` is a valid date string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If the date is not valid, the function should raise a `ValueError`.
3. Validate that `notification_time` is a valid time string in the format 'HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]]'. If the time is not valid, the function should raise a `ValueError`.
4. If all validations pass, create a new `Notification` object with the provided values and save it to the database.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the Django environment is properly set up and that the `Notification` model is correctly configured to interact with the database. You do not need to provide the actual database connection or Django setup code.

You are tasked with creating a Python module that provides functionalities to interact with a dataset repository. The module should allow users to load a dataset from the repository, upload a new dataset to the repository, and list all available datasets in the repository. Each dataset is represented as an `arrow_dataset.Dataset` object.

Write a Python class named `DatasetRepository` that encapsulates these functionalities. The class should have the following methods:

1. `load_dataset(dataset_name: str) -> Dataset`: This method takes the name of the dataset as a string and returns a `Dataset` object if the dataset exists in the repository. If the dataset does not exist, it should raise a `ValueError`.

2. `upload_dataset(dataset: Dataset) -> None`: This method takes a `Dataset` object and uploads it to the repository. If the upload is successful, the method returns nothing. If the dataset already exists in the repository, it should raise a `ValueError`.

3. `list_datasets() -> List[str]`: This method returns a list of strings, where each string is the name of a dataset available in the repository.

For the purpose of this question, you can assume that the functions `load_dataset`, `upload_dataset`, and `list_datasets` from the `.api` module are already implemented and work as expected. You do not need to implement these functions; just use them in your class.

Design a Python class `ModelCheckpoint` that serves as a checkpointing mechanism for a PyTorch model during training. The class should be able to save the model's state dictionary and optimizer's state at regular intervals, as well as save the best model based on a given metric. The class should also create necessary directories for saving the models if they do not exist.

The `ModelCheckpoint` class should have the following features:

1. Initialization with the following parameters:
    - `model`: The PyTorch model to be checkpointed.
    - `exp_info`: A dictionary containing experiment information such as:
        - `'exp_name'`: The name of the experiment.
        - `'saved_path'`: The base directory where model checkpoints will be saved.
    - `model_save_freq`: The frequency (in epochs) at which the model should be saved regularly.
    - `regular_save`: A boolean indicating whether regular saving should be enabled.

2. A method `save_model` that takes the following parameters:
    - `is_best`: A boolean indicating whether the current model is the best model based on the metric.
    - `current_epoch`: The current epoch number.
    - `metric`: A dictionary containing metric information such as:
        - `'im_mean'`: The mean of the metric used to evaluate the model.
        - `'im_std'`: The standard deviation of the metric.

The method should save the model's state dictionary and optimizer's state in two scenarios:
    - Regularly, every `model_save_freq` epochs, if `regular_save` is `True`.
    - When the model is the best model so far, based on the `is_best` flag.

The filenames for the saved models should follow these formats:
    - For regular saves: `""{ExpName}-{Epoch:03d}.pth.tar""`
    - For the best model: `""{ExpName}-{Epoch:03d}-{Acc:4.2f}|{Std:4.2f}.pth.tar""`

Create a Python REST API endpoint using Django REST Framework that allows clients to update the profile image of a tenant in a rental management system. The endpoint should accept a PUT request with a new image file and update the corresponding tenant's profile image. The image should be uploaded to a cloud storage service (for the purpose of this question, assume the cloud storage logic is abstracted away and you only need to call `upload_to_cloud(image)` which returns the URL of the uploaded image).

The `Tenant` model has the following fields:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
- `name`: A string representing the tenant's name.
- `email`: A string representing the tenant's email address.
- `image`: A string representing the URL of the tenant's profile image.

The endpoint should be secured, meaning that only authenticated users can update the profile image. If an unauthenticated request is made, the endpoint should return a 401 Unauthorized response. If the tenant with the given ID does not exist, the endpoint should return a 404 Not Found response.

Write a Django REST Framework serializer and view to implement this functionality. Include the necessary imports, the serializer class, the view class, and the URL configuration. Also, provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

In a simulated robotics environment, a four-wheeled robot (like the Husky robot) is being controlled through voltage signals sent to its left and right wheel motors. The robot's movement is simulated in Gazebo, a robotics simulator. The task is to write a Python function that translates voltage messages received from the robot's control system (Spinnaker) into velocity commands for each of the robot's four wheels.

The function should be named `transceiver_function` and must adhere to the following specifications:

1. The function takes two arguments: `left_voltage_msg` and `right_voltage_msg`. Each argument is a dictionary containing a list of voltages under the key `""voltages""`, where each voltage is a dictionary with a key `""voltage""` that maps to a numerical value representing the voltage applied to the motor.

2. The function should calculate the forward velocity and rotational velocity of the robot based on the voltages. The forward velocity is proportional to the minimum of the two voltages, and the rotational velocity is proportional to the difference between the right and left voltages.

3. The function should create four `GazeboJointDataPack` objects, one for each wheel of the robot, with the following names: `back_left_j`, `back_right_j`, `front_left_j`, and `front_right_j`. The joint names should be formatted as `""husky::<wheel_joint_name>""`, where `<wheel_joint_name>` is replaced with the appropriate joint name for each wheel.

4. The function should assign a velocity to each `GazeboJointDataPack` object's `data.velocity` attribute. The velocity for each wheel is calculated using the forward velocity, the rotational velocity, and a constant that represents the wheel's distance from the center of rotation (0.275 in this case). The velocities for the left wheels should subtract the rotational component, while the velocities for the right wheels should add it. All velocities should be scaled by a factor of 7.

5. If either `left_voltage_msg` or `right_voltage_msg` is `None`, the function should return a list containing the four `GazeboJointDataPack` objects without modifying their velocities.

6. The function should return a list containing the four `GazeboJointDataPack` objects with their velocities set.

Design a role-playing game (RPG) combat system where players can engage in battles with units (enemies). Each player and unit has health points (HP), strength, and defense attributes. Players can also equip weapons and armor to increase their strength and defense, respectively.

The `Player` class inherits from the `Unit` class and has additional properties and methods to manage the player's equipment and actions. The `Item` class represents items that can be equipped by the player, such as weapons and armor, which affect the player's combat abilities.

Implement the `Unit` and `Item` classes based on the provided `Player` class snippet. The `Unit` class should have a constructor that initializes the unit's name, HP, and strength. The `Item` class should have a constructor that initializes the item's name and value.

Additionally, write a `Battle` class that simulates a fight between a player and an enemy unit. The `Battle` class should have a method `fight` that takes a `Player` and a `Unit` as arguments and simulates a turn-based combat until one of them runs out of HP. The method should print the outcome of each attack and the winner at the end of the battle.

Design a Python class `SnapStoreClient` that interacts with a mock Snap Store API to retrieve information about snaps (applications/packages) available in the store. The class should use the provided classes `SnapInfo`, `SnapChannelMapping`, `SnapDetails`, `SnapChannelDetails`, `SnapDownloadDetails`, and `SnapPublisherDetails` to represent the data returned by the API.

The `SnapStoreClient` class should have the following methods:

1. `get_snap_info(snap_name: str) -> SnapInfo`: This method takes the name of a snap and returns a `SnapInfo` object containing all the details of the snap, including its available channels, current revision, publisher, etc.

2. `download_snap(snap_name: str, channel: str, arch: str) -> None`: This method takes the name of a snap, the channel (e.g., 'stable', 'candidate', etc.), and the architecture (e.g., 'amd64', 'armhf', etc.). It should find the corresponding `SnapChannelMapping` and use the `SnapDownloadDetails` to verify the integrity of the downloaded file using the `verify` method. If the verification fails, it should raise an appropriate error.

3. `list_snaps() -> List[str]`: This method returns a list of snap names available in the store.

For the purpose of this exercise, you can assume that the API responses are mocked as dictionaries in the code, and the actual HTTP requests to an API are not required.

Write a Python function `parallel_process_list` that takes a list of items and a function `process_item` to be applied to each item. The function should use multiprocessing to parallelize the processing of the list items. The number of processes should be determined by the `num_processes` parameter. The function should return a list of results after applying the `process_item` function to each item in the input list.

The `process_item` function will be a simple function that takes a single argument (an item from the list) and returns a modified version of the item. For the purpose of this question, assume that `process_item` is a pure function (no side effects) and that it is safe to run in parallel.

The `parallel_process_list` function should handle the division of the list into chunks, the creation of a multiprocessing pool, the distribution of chunks to the pool, and the collection of results.

Here is the skeleton of the function you need to implement:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def parallel_process_list(items, process_item, num_processes):
    """"""

assert parallel_process_list([], lambda x: x * 2, 1) == [], ""Test case 3 failed""
print(""All test cases passed!"")
```

In the solution, we define the `parallel_process_list` function that takes `items`, `process_item`, and `num_processes` as arguments. It uses a helper function `apply_function_on_chunk` to apply the `process_item` function to each chunk of the list. The list is divided into chunks based on the number of processes, and a multiprocessing pool is used to process these chunks in parallel. The results are then flattened into a single list and returned. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function, and test cases are provided to verify the correctness of the solution.",Python,McEval-Instruct

Write a function `largest_rectangle_area` that takes a list of integers representing the heights of histogram bars (where each bar is 1 unit wide) and returns the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram. The histogram is a representation of a bar graph, where the width of each bar is 1 and the height of each bar is determined by the value of the list at that index.

The function should use a stack-based approach to efficiently calculate the largest rectangle area. The stack should keep track of the indices of the bars that are currently being considered for forming the largest rectangle, and it should be used to calculate the area of potential rectangles as the algorithm iterates through the list of heights.

Write a Python function `flatten_memoryview` that takes a multi-dimensional bytes-like object and an optional order parameter (`'C'`, `'F'`, or `'A'`) and returns a flat list of bytes representing the elements of the input object.

2. **Gait Phase Classification**: After uploading the video, the user can start the gait phase classification process. The application should use a pre-trained OpenCV DNN model to detect human body keypoints and classify the gait phase. The keypoints should be drawn on the video frames, and the processed video should be saved to the disk.
3. **Using MediaPipe**: Provide an alternative method for pose estimation using the MediaPipe library. This should also draw keypoints on the video frames and save the processed video.
4. **Live Demo**: Allow the user to start a live demo using their webcam to perform real-time pose estimation with MediaPipe.

It should also provide real-time feedback on the GUI, such as the current status of the processing and any relevant information extracted from the pose estimation (e.g., gait phase, frames per second).

You are tasked with creating a system that manages the configuration of a machine learning model's weights and sequences. The model uses two sets of weights and a sequence of operations to make predictions. The weights and sequences are stored in JSON files for persistence. Your job is to write a Python program that can upload new weights and sequences to their respective JSON files and download them when needed.

The program should consist of the following functions:

1. `upload_weights(columns, weights1, weights2)`: This function takes three arguments: `columns` (a list of column names), `weights1`, and `weights2` (both lists of numerical values representing the weights). It should save these into a JSON file named `w0.json` with a structure that maps ""col"" to `columns`, ""w1"" to `weights1`, and ""w2"" to `weights2`.

2. `download_weights()`: This function reads the `w0.json` file and returns a tuple containing `columns`, `weights1`, and `weights2` in that order.

3. `upload_sequences(sequences)`: This function takes one argument: `sequences` (a list of strings representing the sequence of operations). It should save these into a JSON file named `s_conf.json` with a structure that maps ""sequences"" to `sequences`.

4. `download_sequences()`: This function reads the `s_conf.json` file and returns the list of sequences.

Write the code for the above functions and provide test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Write a Python script that automates the creation of Elasticsearch indices for each month of the current year. The script should check if an index for a particular month already exists, and if not, it should create it with a specified number of shards and replicas. The script should output the status of each index, indicating whether it was already present or newly created.

The script should follow these requirements:

1. Use the Elasticsearch 6.x Python client.
2. Generate the current year dynamically.
3. Define the Elasticsearch host configuration.
4. Use a tuple to store the names of the months.

Design a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Python that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The ATM will interact with `cardHolder` objects that represent bank customers. Each `cardHolder` has a card number, PIN, first name, last name, and balance.

The ATM should provide a text-based menu with the following options:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Show Balance
4. Exit

The user should be prompted to insert their debit card number and PIN to access the ATM services. If the card number or PIN is incorrect, the user should be notified and asked to try again. Once authenticated, the user can perform transactions by choosing the appropriate menu option.

Implement the `cardHolder` class with the necessary attributes and methods to support the ATM operations. The class should have methods to get and set the balance, get the card number, get the PIN, and get the first name of the cardholder.

Write a Python script that simulates the ATM operations. The script should handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide appropriate messages to the user. Ensure that the withdrawal operation checks for sufficient funds before allowing the transaction.

2. A post list page that displays all posts with pagination, showing 4 posts per page.
3. A search functionality that allows users to search for posts based on the title, author, content, or a custom field called 'batch'. The search results should be distinct and ordered by the published date.
4. Category-specific post list pages that filter posts by their category (e.g., 'DR', 'NA', 'TH', 'E', 'SC') with pagination, showing 4 posts per page.
5. A post detail page that displays the full content of a post when accessed by its unique identifier (primary key).
6. An about page that provides information about the blog.
7. A categories page that lists all the available categories.
8. A principal page that provides a welcome message or introduction to the blog.

The search should be recursive, meaning it should be able to find variables nested within other variables.

The class should have the following features:
- A constructor that takes a list of search terms (variable names) to look for within the configuration.
- A `search` method that takes a configuration object and returns a dictionary with the search terms as keys and the found values as values. If a term is not found, its value should be `None`.

Write a Python program that generates a BED (Browser Extensible Data) file containing genomic windows of a specified size. The BED file format is commonly used to represent genomic features such as regions of DNA, genes, or other annotations. Each line of a BED file typically includes a chromosome name, start position, end position, and optionally a name for the feature.

Your program should take as input a FASTA file containing genomic sequences and output a BED file with windows of a specified size across the genome. The program should also handle various options to customize the output, such as adding feature names, applying a name prefix, ignoring windows with a high percentage of 'N' bases (which represent unknown bases), centering the windows on the chromosome, and substituting chromosome names based on a regular expression.

The program should follow these specifications:

1. Read genomic sequences from a FASTA file, where each sequence is associated with a chromosome name.
2. Generate windows of a specified size across each chromosome.
3. Skip windows that contain a percentage of 'N' bases greater than a specified threshold.
4. Optionally, center the windows on the chromosome, leaving the same number of bases off the beginning and end of the chromosome.
5. Optionally, substitute chromosome names based on a provided regular expression pattern and replacement string.
6. Optionally, add names for each BED feature in the format ""chrom_start_end"" or with a specified prefix.
7. Output the BED file to standard output.

**Test Cases**:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can save the above script as `generate_bed.py` and run it with different command-line arguments. Here are some example commands and expected outputs:

1. `python generate_bed.py genome.fa`
   - This should output BED features for each window across the genome with the default window size of 1000 and no feature names.

2. `python generate_bed.py genome.fa --windowSize 500 --addnames`
   - This should output BED features with a window size of 500 and feature names in the format ""chrom_start_end"".

3. `python generate_bed.py genome.fa --windowSize 500 --addnames --nameprefix myFeature`
   - This should output BED features with a window size of 500 and feature names with the prefix ""myFeature"".

4. `python generate_bed.py genome.fa --NignorePct 0.1`
   - This should output BED features for each window, skipping those with more than 10% 'N' bases.

5. `python generate_bed.py genome.fa --chromname_sub_regex ""chr"" ""chromosome""`
   - This should output BED features with chromosome names substituted according to the regex pattern and replacement string.

A research team is conducting a study on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and has collected data from various participants. The participants are categorized into three groups: Asymptomatic AD, Control, and Symptomatic AD. Each participant has a unique identifier that starts with 'UWA' followed by a series of numbers (e.g., 'UWA626'). The team has stored the data in a CSV file where each row represents a participant's data, and one of the columns is 'PSM_ID' containing these unique identifiers.

The task is to write a Python script that reads the input CSV file, determines the study group for each participant based on their 'PSM_ID', and writes the results to a new CSV file. The new CSV file should have an additional column 'study_group' that specifies the group of the participant, while preserving the rest of the data from the input file.

The script should be executable from the command line, taking two arguments: the path to the input CSV file and the path to the output CSV file.

Design a Django application model for a music marketplace where bands can list their merchandise. The application should have two main models: `Band` and `MerchandiseListing`. The `Band` model represents musical groups with attributes such as name, genre, biography, year formed, whether they are currently active, and their official homepage. The `MerchandiseListing` model represents items for sale, with attributes such as title, description, price, and a reference to the band selling the item. Ensure that the price field only allows positive values and includes a string representation for each model.

Implement the models with appropriate fields, relationships, and validations. Write a Python code snippet that defines these models using Django's ORM, and provide test cases to demonstrate the creation of `Band` and `MerchandiseListing` instances, ensuring that the validations are working as expected.

Write a Python script that automates the process of managing data processing tasks within a specified directory. The script should be able to load a checkpoint file, update processing options based on command-line arguments, and resume the processing from a specific point. The script should also handle changing the working directory if specified and log errors appropriately.

The script should follow these requirements:

1. The script should use a command-line interface to accept arguments for the directory to change to (`--dir`), whether to backup data (`--backup`), whether to process anomalous data (`--anom`), and the resolution to use (`--res`).
2. If the `--dir` argument is provided, the script should change the current working directory to the specified directory.
3. The script should attempt to load a checkpoint file. If the file does not exist or cannot be loaded, it should log an error message and exit with an error code.
4. The script should create an instance of `Manager` with the loaded checkpoint.
5. The script should update the `Manager` options based on the provided command-line arguments. If `--anom` is provided and differs from the current setting, it should update the 'anomalous' option. If `--res` is provided, it should update the 'resolution' option.
6. The script should resume the processing from the checkpoint's 'run_position' and the 'strategy' stage, applying any option overrides.
7. The script should handle a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception by exiting gracefully with an error code.

1. `python script.py --dir /path/to/data --backup --anom True --res 2.0`
   - Changes the working directory to `/path/to/data`.
   - Loads the checkpoint file.
   - Sets the backup option to `True`.
   - Sets the anomalous processing option to `True`.
   - Sets the resolution to `2.0`.
   - Resumes processing from the checkpoint's 'run_position' and the 'strategy' stage.

2. `python script.py`
   - Does not change the working directory.
   - Loads the checkpoint file.
   - Uses default processing options.
   - Resumes processing from the checkpoint's 'run_position' and the 'strategy' stage.

3. `python script.py --dir /invalid/path`
   - Attempts to change the working directory to `/invalid/path` and fails.
   - Logs an error message and exits with an error code.

Design a Python program that scrapes rental housing information from a real estate website for multiple cities using asynchronous programming and data parsing techniques. The program should be able to handle user input for the city name, fetch the total number of pages of rental listings, and then asynchronously scrape data from each page. The data to be scraped includes the title, region, area, floor, and price of the rental properties. The program should also clean the data by removing spaces and newline characters and combine the large and small region information into a single field.

A linked list is a data structure where each element (commonly called a node) contains some data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. In addition to the `next` pointer, each node in this particular linked list also contains a `random` pointer which can point to any node in the list or `None` (null).

Write a function `deep_copy_random_list` that takes the head of such a linked list as an argument and returns a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of entirely new `RandomListNode` instances that replicate the structure of the original list, including the `random` pointers.

A `RandomListNode` is defined as follows:

```python
class RandomListNode:
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label
        self.next = None
        self.random = None
```

The function should handle cases where the list is empty (i.e., the head is `None`), and it should create new nodes with the same labels as the original nodes. The `random` pointers in the new list should point to the corresponding nodes in the new list, not the original list.

Design a Python class `TestOptions` that extends a base class `BaseOptions` to parse command-line arguments for configuring test settings in a machine learning application. The `TestOptions` class should initialize a parser with specific arguments related to testing configurations, such as the number of test examples, results directory, aspect ratio of result images, phase, which epoch to load, dataset names, image size, GPU selection, model subfolder, feature type, weights filename, and a random seed.

The `TestOptions` class should also ensure that the `isTrain` attribute is set to `False` to indicate that the options are for testing purposes. Additionally, the class should set a default value for `loadSize` to be the same as `fineSize` to avoid cropping during image loading.

Implement the `TestOptions` class with the `initialize` method that takes a parser as an argument and adds the necessary arguments with their default values and help messages. Also, provide a simple example of how to use this class to parse command-line arguments.

Write a Python class `TsIniPreProcessor` that processes TunerStudio INI files with pre-processing directives to conditionally include or exclude lines based on defined symbols. The INI files may contain directives such as `#if`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#else`, `#set`, and `#unset`. The class should use a grammar file for parsing these directives and apply them to the input INI content.

The class should have the following methods:
- `__init__`: Initializes the preprocessor with an empty symbol table and sets up the parser with the provided grammar and transformer.
- `define`: Adds a symbol to the symbol table with a specified value (True or False).
- `pre_process`: Parses the input INI content and applies the pre-processing directives based on the current symbol table.

The class should also include a `pp_transformer` subclass of `Transformer` that implements the logic for handling the pre-processing directives.

The `pp_transformer` should have methods to handle the following:
- `pp_conditional`: Processes conditional blocks and includes the first block that evaluates to True.
- `if_part`: Processes the `#if` part of a conditional.
- `ifndef_line`: Processes the `#ifndef` directive.
- `elif_part`: Processes the `#elif` part of a conditional.
- `set`: Processes the `#set` directive and adds a symbol to the symbol table.
- `unset`: Processes the `#unset` directive and removes a symbol from the symbol table.
- `symbol`: Checks if a symbol is defined in the symbol table.
- `expression`: Processes expressions, supporting symbols and negated symbols.

The class should use the `lark` library for parsing and the `more_itertools` library for finding the first true conditional block. The grammar file for parsing should be named `pre_processor.lark` and should be located in the same directory as the script.

Design a Python class named `SerialCommunication` that encapsulates the functionality for communicating with a serial device. The class should provide methods to open and close the serial connection, read data from the serial port, and check if the connection is open. The class should handle exceptions gracefully and provide user-friendly messages in case of errors.

The class should have the following specifications:

1. The constructor (`__init__`) should automatically detect available serial ports and allow the user to select a port by entering its name. If no ports are detected, it should prompt the user to enter the port name manually. The default baud rate should be set to 9600.

2. The `open_connection` method should attempt to open the serial connection with the specified port name and baud rate. If the connection fails, it should print an error message.

3. The `close_connection` method should close the serial connection if it is open. If the connection is already closed, it should print a message indicating that the port is already closed.

4. The `read_data` method should read a line of data from the serial port, decode it to UTF-8, and strip any whitespace. If the data is not 'Empty' or 'Fail', and if the data length is less than 5 characters, it should return the data as an integer. Otherwise, it should return `None`.

5. The `is_connection_open` method should return a boolean indicating whether the serial connection is currently open.

The provided solution constructs a binary tree from the given preorder and inorder traversal lists using a recursive approach. The `buildTree` function is the main entry point, which uses a helper function to construct the tree recursively. The helper function takes the start and end indices of the current subtree in both the preorder and inorder lists and builds the tree by finding the root and recursively constructing the left and right subtrees. The test cases at the end of the code snippet are used to verify the correctness of the solution.",Python,McEval-Instruct
